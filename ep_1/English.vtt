19:02.130 --> 19:03.580
you can apply to be transferred back, right?

19:05.370 --> 19:05.880
I'm not going back.

19:06.830 --> 19:07.440
I'm staying here.

19:18.650 --> 19:19.630
What brings you here?

19:23.290 --> 19:24.210
The girl in the car

19:24.250 --> 19:25.090
does international trade.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.970
She came here for business.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.260
So I came here for a trip.

19:30.910 --> 19:31.670
It's so snowy

19:32.550 --> 19:33.140
and you're here for a trip?

19:34.240 --> 19:37.200
Snow is also a specialty here.

20:03.150 --> 20:03.590
Captain Lu.

20:05.640 --> 20:06.030
Captain Lu.

20:06.690 --> 20:07.640
This is the person who called the police.

20:07.780 --> 20:08.260
I'll leave it to you.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.090
This is her car.

20:10.390 --> 20:11.190
And these cars

20:11.440 --> 20:12.150
were also stolen.

20:13.930 --> 20:15.580
These stolen cars already have a police report lodged.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.160
The thieves have been apprehended

20:19.240 --> 20:20.160
but they refused to tell us

20:20.180 --> 20:21.060
where the stolen cars were hidden.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.530
Turns out they were hidden here.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.070
I found it by chance.

20:25.690 --> 20:26.260
I'll leave it to you.

20:26.550 --> 20:28.620
- I’ve got something else on. I’m leaving.
- Okay, go ahead.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.660
Hello, I'm the car owner.

20:33.880 --> 20:34.240
Okay.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.800
If it's convenient,

20:36.320 --> 20:37.270
could you drive back

20:37.720 --> 20:38.370
with me

20:38.790 --> 20:39.570
to take a statement?

20:40.220 --> 20:40.920
Sure.

20:41.270 --> 20:41.630
Okay.

20:53.260 --> 20:53.820
Thank you.

20:56.240 --> 20:56.680
You're welcome.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.360
Where are you going next?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.160
We want to stay in town for a few days

21:03.190 --> 21:04.360
and then go to Qining City.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.450
Business first, then travel.

21:10.290 --> 21:11.380
Are you close to that

21:12.000 --> 21:12.810
Captain Lu just now?

21:15.030 --> 21:16.100
We've known each other for years.

21:16.820 --> 21:17.730
But we only meet

21:17.960 --> 21:18.870
a few times a year.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.600
He's in Qining City.

21:20.920 --> 21:21.670
He doesn't come here often.

21:22.970 --> 21:25.080
He's a nice guy.

21:25.790 --> 21:27.230
He's always on the frontline of the SWAT.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.000
It must be tiring to be on the frontline.

21:29.350 --> 21:30.220
Of course.

21:31.190 --> 21:31.910
It's also very dangerous.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.120
But he’s an instructor now.

21:35.490 --> 21:36.360
He teaches others how to detonate bombs.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.630
When he is on a mission,

21:39.080 --> 21:40.300
he would be on the frontline of counterterrorism.

21:41.670 --> 21:42.300
He has

21:42.780 --> 21:44.110
trained many heroes

21:45.240 --> 21:45.990
to protect the people.

21:46.830 --> 21:47.320
A real man.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.560
Bomb detonation?

21:51.710 --> 21:52.830
He's a bomb detonation expert?

21:53.580 --> 21:54.090
Yes.

21:55.430 --> 21:56.440
Their team

21:56.530 --> 21:57.790
is the counterterrorism team.

21:58.710 --> 21:59.490
There were dozens of experts

22:00.180 --> 22:02.440
that came out of the bomb detonation team.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.640
They were all poached internally.

22:05.850 --> 22:06.420
Captain Lu

22:06.990 --> 22:09.280
could detonate a ticking bomb in 30 seconds

22:09.670 --> 22:11.080
without even breaking a sweat.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.200
This is not a movie.

22:13.980 --> 22:14.860
It really happened.

22:23.180 --> 22:24.410
You're here to fix the roof?

22:29.040 --> 22:29.960
Be careful.

23:20.180 --> 23:20.720
Lu!

23:21.370 --> 23:22.290
The old captain's father

23:22.330 --> 23:23.130
is waiting for you.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.400
What's wrong?

23:37.650 --> 23:38.410
You came all the way here

23:38.440 --> 23:39.280
to get some fresh air?

23:42.600 --> 23:44.000
I wanted to visit the old captain's father first.

23:45.100 --> 23:45.780
But I thought about it

23:46.640 --> 23:47.280
and decided not to.

23:49.670 --> 23:50.470
You have no idea

23:52.060 --> 23:53.050
how they made me cry.

23:55.070 --> 23:56.080
You can cry in front of me,

23:56.470 --> 23:57.420
but don't cry at their place.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.050
I understand.

24:11.420 --> 24:12.700
We can't use these planks anymore.

24:16.450 --> 24:17.470
Pass me the toolbox

24:17.710 --> 24:18.510
and the boards we brought

24:18.530 --> 24:19.060
from the car.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.040
I'll fix the opening gap first.

24:22.510 --> 24:23.690
Otherwise, with this heavy snow,

24:23.920 --> 24:25.100
the things in it

24:25.470 --> 24:27.190
will get wet when the snow melts.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.760
Okay, we have work to do again.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.200
Be careful.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.190
Thank you.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.560
This is from me personally.

24:56.750 --> 24:57.390
No, no.

24:57.770 --> 24:58.200
Uncle,

24:58.600 --> 24:59.640
I've been in Qining for so many years.

25:00.270 --> 25:01.390
I've been taken care of by your family.

25:02.920 --> 25:03.610
Chinese New Year is coming.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.420
Take it as some sincerity by me,

25:05.670 --> 25:06.380
who take you as dear as my father.

25:08.050 --> 25:10.850
He doesn't spend much.

25:11.790 --> 25:12.780
He also saved a lot.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.330
He's not even here anymore.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.730
Chen, I really don't need it.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.010
Don't take it to heart.

25:41.170 --> 25:42.170
I still have to count on you

25:43.570 --> 25:44.530
in Qining.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.480
Of course. I don't need you to remind me.

25:49.370 --> 25:50.710
I'll go back to the team later. What about you?

25:54.790 --> 25:55.190
Oh right,

25:55.280 --> 25:56.480
you have to pick up Nan for me.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.650
Have you asked Captain Lu yet?

26:27.810 --> 26:28.410
No.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.430
I'm treating.

26:34.540 --> 26:35.300
I asked you to ask them out,

26:35.320 --> 26:36.530
not to pay.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.440
I don't want to ask him out no matter how much money it is.

26:41.390 --> 26:42.540
How can you be so cruel?

26:43.350 --> 26:44.310
It snowed so heavily yesterday.

26:44.340 --> 26:45.820
He came to help you.

26:45.950 --> 26:47.140
And I'm not the only one.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.750
Zhou and Lin Yao

26:48.870 --> 26:49.800
want to treat him to dinner too.

26:50.490 --> 26:52.160
He didn't like socialising.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.570
It's not socialising. It's just a meal to say thanks.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.800
We just admire heroes.

27:09.700 --> 27:10.650
I have his number anyway.

27:13.350 --> 27:14.330
Don't call him.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.600
No, I don't know him well.

27:17.040 --> 27:17.760
Gui Xiao.

27:17.780 --> 27:19.080
Why are you embarrassed?

27:19.140 --> 27:20.410
You're being very immature.

27:21.020 --> 27:21.980
He helped you so much.

27:22.440 --> 27:22.800
He answered.

27:23.240 --> 27:23.680
Hello?

27:24.660 --> 27:25.430
Hello, Captain Lu.

27:25.590 --> 27:26.430
I'm Cai Yaya,

27:26.710 --> 27:27.600
Gui Xiao's friend.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.180
We met yesterday.

27:29.940 --> 27:30.340
Hello.

27:31.910 --> 27:32.180
Yes.

27:32.490 --> 27:34.040
Gui Xiao's phone didn't have any signal yesterday

27:34.500 --> 27:35.510
so we called you with my phone.

27:36.110 --> 27:37.000
Please don't mind that

27:37.000 --> 27:38.030
I've saved your number.

27:41.200 --> 27:41.720
It's okay.

27:42.780 --> 27:43.830
Did something happen?

27:44.150 --> 27:45.020
No.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.650
I just want to treat you to a meal

27:46.680 --> 27:47.540
to express my gratitude.

27:48.980 --> 27:49.980
You have no idea how important

27:50.010 --> 27:51.060
this car is to me.

27:51.310 --> 27:52.490
My husband just gave it to me.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.190
If I lose it, it would bring a huge crisis to my family.

27:55.450 --> 27:56.690
Thank you so much.

27:58.020 --> 27:59.520
Let's not delay it. How about tonight?

28:01.260 --> 28:01.850
Okay.

28:02.030 --> 28:03.110
I'll send you

28:03.130 --> 28:03.970
the restaurant address later.

28:05.080 --> 28:05.470
Okay.

28:08.550 --> 28:09.200
Get changed.

28:09.430 --> 28:10.150
Let's go eat.

28:23.250 --> 28:23.690
Close the door.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.580
Your awareness is amazing.

28:33.540 --> 28:34.490
You call this awareness?

28:35.150 --> 28:36.340
That's nothing.

28:38.590 --> 28:39.190
You're going home?

28:39.830 --> 28:40.240
Going for dinner.

28:42.010 --> 28:42.610
With whom?

28:43.200 --> 28:43.880
An old friend.

28:46.710 --> 28:49.080
You have friends

28:49.760 --> 28:51.330
besides colleagues?

28:54.940 --> 28:56.200
You've grown taller.

28:56.970 --> 28:57.730
You are half a head taller

28:57.760 --> 28:58.690
than your classmates.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.120
Of course.

29:01.830 --> 29:02.350
Fasten your seat belt.

29:49.940 --> 29:50.660
This is it.

29:57.050 --> 29:58.210
Whose child is this?

29:59.280 --> 30:00.440
Tell their parents,

30:00.460 --> 30:01.960
if not they might get worried that their kid went to the wrong room.

30:02.810 --> 30:04.810
Auntie, I’m with Lu Yanchen.

30:05.580 --> 30:06.660
My dad went to make a call.

30:07.170 --> 30:08.650
He asked me to wait for the guests here.

30:11.640 --> 30:12.560
I need to use the bathroom.

30:13.860 --> 30:15.750
Auntie, go out and turn right.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.160
The toilet is right at the end.

30:20.410 --> 30:21.630
Uncles, auntie, please sit down.

30:23.350 --> 30:24.360
This kid is so sensible.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.240
My dad taught me well.

30:49.550 --> 30:50.850
We broke up ten years ago.

30:51.770 --> 30:52.900
This child is so big.

30:53.900 --> 30:54.450
It makes sense.

30:55.870 --> 30:57.270
He said he would stay here in the future,

30:58.080 --> 30:59.540
which means he has a home here.

31:00.830 --> 31:02.100
Everything makes sense.

31:03.000 --> 31:03.880
So, Gui Xiao,

31:05.600 --> 31:07.040
why are you still looking for him?

31:18.990 --> 31:19.600
What are you looking at?

31:31.720 --> 31:32.510
The ladies' room is downstairs.

31:36.990 --> 31:37.390
Come back.

31:38.510 --> 31:39.070
I'll take you there.

31:39.710 --> 31:40.060
No need.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.070
I asked you to come back, you hear me?

31:44.420 --> 31:45.960
Isn't it just because I dumped you back then?

31:46.630 --> 31:47.430
You have a child now.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.500
Why are you still acting like I owe you?

31:48.530 --> 31:48.930
What are you doing?

31:50.480 --> 31:51.040
I didn't hear you.

31:53.640 --> 31:54.320
You didn't hear me?

31:55.230 --> 31:55.950
Then why are you turning back?

31:58.520 --> 31:59.160
She

31:59.190 --> 32:00.270
doesn't want to talk to you.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.500
Please forgive him, Miss.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.410
Captain Lu is...

32:08.090 --> 32:08.860
I mean, the former captain,

32:09.110 --> 32:10.800
he just submitted his resignation report.

32:12.150 --> 32:13.630
He has nothing better to do.

32:15.330 --> 32:16.000
Acting all weird.

32:17.390 --> 32:18.290
Didn't you say...

32:18.400 --> 32:19.720
I'm unemployed now.

32:20.610 --> 32:20.970
Why?

32:21.950 --> 32:23.230
You think it's not worth buying me a meal now?

32:27.210 --> 32:29.110
Miss, don't be too offended.

32:29.410 --> 32:30.970
Captain Lu is very straightforward with his words.

32:33.010 --> 32:33.490
I know.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.940
Actually, Captain Lu

32:37.190 --> 32:38.070
is still hesitating

32:38.070 --> 32:38.760
whether he should go back to Beijing or not.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.620
He's hesitating.

32:40.330 --> 32:41.970
He's not exactly unemployed.

32:42.030 --> 32:43.790
It's just temporary unemployment.

32:45.440 --> 32:46.190
I might not necessarily go back.

32:48.710 --> 32:50.020
It's quite troublesome to return to Beijing

32:50.040 --> 32:50.730
if you have to bring your wife and kid along.

32:51.330 --> 32:52.250
Household registration would be troublesome too.

32:53.030 --> 32:54.070
If you need

32:54.090 --> 32:55.300
any help,

32:55.640 --> 32:56.240
you can look for me.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.800
Looks like your son is up to something again.

33:04.850 --> 33:05.560
No way.

33:05.580 --> 33:06.740
He's so afraid of you.

33:06.770 --> 33:07.890
How could he play tricks on you?

33:09.580 --> 33:10.180
But it's possible too.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.280
He's grown up

33:11.340 --> 33:12.060
and is bolder now.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.860
Miss, here's the thing.

33:17.650 --> 33:19.000
Miss, please forgive me.

33:19.210 --> 33:20.330
That is my son.

33:20.840 --> 33:21.430
My son

33:21.450 --> 33:22.600
knows there are many bachelors in the team.

33:23.180 --> 33:24.540
When they go on blind dates,

33:24.560 --> 33:25.080
he'd pull some tricks.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.720
He kept calling them his father,

33:26.740 --> 33:27.780
chasing away many ladies.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.160
I apologize.

33:30.110 --> 33:31.420
So that's not your son.

33:35.240 --> 33:35.790
What a pity.

33:36.730 --> 33:37.380
He's so cute.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.480
He's cute?

33:39.530 --> 33:41.050
That brat is up to no good.

33:41.770 --> 33:42.100
Oh right,

33:42.500 --> 33:43.380
let me introduce myself.

33:43.550 --> 33:44.650
My name is Qin Mingyu.

33:45.180 --> 33:46.180
I'm from Lu Yanchen's team.

33:46.870 --> 33:48.070
That brat is my son.

33:48.310 --> 33:48.910
His name is Qin Xiaonan.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.010
I'm Gui Xiao.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.600
Weren't you going to the toilet?

33:58.180 --> 33:58.980
I don't want to go anymore.

34:15.690 --> 34:16.090
Dad.

34:17.080 --> 34:17.560
Hello.

34:19.590 --> 34:20.820
You played tricks again.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.699
Dang, we all got it wrong.

34:23.159 --> 34:23.510
Here.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.250
Apologize to Auntie Gui Xiao.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.310
Auntie, I was wrong.

34:28.159 --> 34:28.880
It's okay.

34:29.590 --> 34:30.670
Don't stand around. Sit down.

34:31.280 --> 34:31.610
Sit.

34:32.639 --> 34:33.920
Captain Lu, please have a seat.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.320
I don’t know much

34:40.340 --> 34:41.080
about the restaurants here.

34:41.100 --> 34:42.179
I picked this place based on its reviews.

34:42.830 --> 34:43.230
As to the dishes,

34:43.260 --> 34:44.679
I'll ask the waiter to serve the signature dishes.

34:44.760 --> 34:45.420
Is that okay?

34:46.790 --> 34:48.070
Captain Lu, is there anything you don't eat?

34:48.690 --> 34:49.159
He eats anything.

34:55.949 --> 34:56.270
No.

34:58.150 --> 34:58.730
Okay.

35:07.400 --> 35:07.970
Please enjoy.

35:14.350 --> 35:14.870
Captain Lu,

35:15.510 --> 35:16.700
were you neighbors

35:16.730 --> 35:17.940
or schoolmates

35:18.270 --> 35:19.570
with Gui Xiao?

35:19.800 --> 35:20.270
Schoolmates.

35:21.250 --> 35:21.630
We're not close.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.940
Qining's snow is so heavy.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.010
Captain Lu

35:32.210 --> 35:32.970
is not good at talking.

35:33.270 --> 35:35.130
We've sat here for a while now

35:35.160 --> 35:35.880
but he hasn't talked much.

35:36.150 --> 35:37.150
But Captain Lu

35:37.200 --> 35:38.580
is someone who's cold on the outside but warm on the inside.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.310
He must treat you

35:40.330 --> 35:40.930
as friends,

35:40.960 --> 35:41.420
that's why he's here.

35:42.210 --> 35:42.810
Right, Captain Lu?

35:48.130 --> 35:50.090
Schoolmates right? Chat a little.

35:55.280 --> 35:55.710
Have a drink.

35:56.590 --> 35:57.580
- Drink your own.
- Captain Lu has to drive.

36:04.710 --> 36:05.360
Exactly, dad.

36:06.120 --> 36:06.670
Eat your food.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.030
I was thinking

36:16.060 --> 36:17.420
Captain Lu's going to Beijing soon.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.420
Please take care of him.

36:21.690 --> 36:22.810
If you can't say it yourself,

36:22.840 --> 36:23.400
I'll say it instead.

36:27.470 --> 36:27.830
Here.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.090
You have to drive later.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.170
Let's drink tea instead of wine.

36:32.940 --> 36:33.660
I will drink a toast to everyone.

36:34.950 --> 36:36.540
When you come to Qining in the future,

36:37.120 --> 36:38.130
if you have any problems,

36:38.260 --> 36:39.700
just let me know, okay?

36:41.310 --> 36:41.990
I hope

36:42.020 --> 36:43.050
you can take care of Captain Lu

36:43.520 --> 36:44.680
in Beijing for me too.

36:45.610 --> 36:46.450
Of course.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.340
We have to repay more than what we received.

36:48.610 --> 36:49.330
Let alone Captain Lu has

36:49.360 --> 36:50.330
helped us a lot.

36:50.650 --> 36:51.440
We will help you in any way possible

36:51.470 --> 36:51.940
in the future.

36:52.280 --> 36:52.800
Of course we'll help.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.790
As long as Captain Lu asks, I'll be there at any time.

36:55.040 --> 36:55.760
Thank you, everyone.

37:14.230 --> 37:15.310
By the way, the four of you

37:15.330 --> 37:16.410
came here in one car, right?

37:16.900 --> 37:17.230
Yes.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.830
Captain Lu, send them.

37:20.550 --> 37:21.590
Four people in a car

37:21.990 --> 37:22.830
is too crowded. It's not safe.

37:23.560 --> 37:24.710
Is it too troublesome?

37:25.570 --> 37:26.580
No, auntie.

37:27.060 --> 37:27.950
We live in the west.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.040
And you live in the east.

37:30.080 --> 37:30.980
Although it's not very convenient,

37:31.270 --> 37:32.510
it shows

37:32.730 --> 37:33.810
our sincerity by sending the guests off.

37:34.590 --> 37:35.790
Captain Lu and I

37:35.810 --> 37:37.010
shall go get our cars from the parking lot.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.450
You guys wait here.

37:38.480 --> 37:38.790
Okay.

37:42.230 --> 37:43.350
Come with me.

37:43.450 --> 37:44.130
Otherwise, I'll be frozen

37:44.160 --> 37:44.940
to death by how cold he is.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.000
I'll wait for you here.

37:46.640 --> 37:47.710
No, it's cold outside.

37:47.730 --> 37:48.410
Come with me. Let's go.

38:03.080 --> 38:03.550
Captain Lu.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.170
My car is over there.

38:05.480 --> 38:05.840
What about you?

38:07.770 --> 38:08.160
Over there.

38:09.010 --> 38:09.540
It's not far.

38:37.730 --> 38:38.280
Don't come out.

38:49.100 --> 38:49.770
Lu Chen!

39:13.750 --> 39:14.420
Gui Xiao.

39:14.660 --> 39:15.290
Are you okay?

39:15.850 --> 39:16.880
I was shoved a few times.

39:16.920 --> 39:17.910
What are they doing?

39:26.410 --> 39:27.410
Watch out, Lu!

39:44.240 --> 39:44.820
Dad.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.360
I already called the police

39:46.380 --> 39:47.660
with his phone.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.270
Well done!

40:25.350 --> 40:25.800
Are you scared?

40:27.770 --> 40:28.240
No.

40:29.270 --> 40:29.860
What is there to be scared of?

40:31.720 --> 40:32.640
I covered you with my clothes

40:33.130 --> 40:33.940
because I didn't want to scare you.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.720
I didn't expect you

40:35.740 --> 40:36.500
to not take the hint at all

40:36.980 --> 40:37.880
and pulled it off,

40:38.300 --> 40:39.120
watching it all the way.

40:42.060 --> 40:42.470
Here.

40:54.170 --> 40:54.900
Is there snow?

41:00.640 --> 41:01.040
No.

41:26.010 --> 41:26.480
Captain Lu.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.280
We meet again.

41:30.000 --> 41:30.850
I'll leave them to you.

41:31.420 --> 41:31.900
They're car thieves.

41:32.950 --> 41:33.310
Okay.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.000
Thank you.

41:36.080 --> 41:36.640
I've got them to speak up.

41:37.100 --> 41:37.660
They are friends

41:37.690 --> 41:38.730
of the group of people who stole the cars.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.060
They happen to be eating here.

41:40.570 --> 41:41.840
They recognized the car at first sight.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.320
So they wanted to avenge

41:43.360 --> 41:43.910
for their friends.

41:43.930 --> 41:44.820
But they didn't expect it's us who they'd face.

41:45.430 --> 41:46.060
Chief Liu,

41:46.640 --> 41:47.240
we captured

41:47.260 --> 41:48.490
13 people for you,

41:48.680 --> 41:49.840
you should treat Captain Lu and me

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
to a big meal.

41:51.170 --> 41:51.670
Of course.

41:52.300 --> 41:54.380
Eat all you want at the police cafeteria.

41:57.970 --> 41:59.000
Your car

41:59.230 --> 42:00.400
should be commended

42:00.760 --> 42:02.060
for saving our police force.

42:02.370 --> 42:03.210
It also saved resources

42:03.570 --> 42:04.600
for the country.

42:05.630 --> 42:06.530
Sorry for the trouble.

42:06.970 --> 42:08.410
Not at all. I'm happy.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.440
A kid reported the case just now.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.140
Who was it?

42:12.170 --> 42:12.590
Me.

42:13.000 --> 42:13.590
My son.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.240
As usual.

42:17.310 --> 42:17.930
As usual.

42:18.230 --> 42:19.260
We'll go back and make a statement with you.

42:27.850 --> 42:29.040
You drive Cai Yaya's car

42:29.070 --> 42:29.890
and send those two men back.

42:30.340 --> 42:31.820
I'll drive them home.

42:32.450 --> 42:32.770
Okay.

42:35.170 --> 42:36.380
I'll go with Uncle Lu.

42:39.770 --> 42:41.320
Now you know it's Uncle Lu?

42:41.360 --> 42:44.410
[Establish a positive image for public security]

42:42.400 --> 42:43.390
I don't mind

42:43.680 --> 42:44.560
if you want me to call you dad.

42:45.780 --> 42:46.660
W-why?

42:47.030 --> 42:48.150
Can't I have two dads?

42:49.290 --> 42:50.730
Thank you, Captain Qin.

42:52.320 --> 42:52.670
Let's go.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.290
Auntie, don't be angry.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.270
Uncle Lu has a cold face.

43:08.690 --> 43:09.410
He treats everyone the same.

43:10.510 --> 43:11.150
I'm not angry.

43:12.340 --> 43:13.370
I'm used to it.

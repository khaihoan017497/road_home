20:36.980 --> 20:37.800
Don't give it too much thought.

20:38.810 --> 20:40.110
He didn't say anything.

20:51.820 --> 20:52.230
Hello?

20:55.700 --> 20:56.440
Sorry, Gui Xiao.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.300
Something urgent came up at home.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.120
I'm back for two days.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.340
But I had a busy schedule.

21:05.690 --> 21:06.170
It's okay.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.110
I'm leaving Beijing the day after tomorrow.

21:11.440 --> 21:12.600
The Chinese New Year is coming.

21:12.820 --> 21:13.460
It's not suitable

21:13.460 --> 21:14.830
to leave the kid to my friends.

21:16.390 --> 21:17.710
I heard you were back.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.110
So I wanted to ask you when you will be free

21:21.140 --> 21:22.220
to pick up the kid.

21:24.670 --> 21:25.180
The day after tomorrow.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.390
How about I just drive him there?

21:31.730 --> 21:32.530
I'll go tomorrow.

21:34.130 --> 21:34.830
It's a deal.

21:37.010 --> 21:37.560
Thank you.

21:40.200 --> 21:40.730
No problem.

21:42.310 --> 21:43.310
I can help you.

22:40.580 --> 22:41.090
Lu Chen.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.420
I'm saving money.

22:59.910 --> 23:01.140
I'll visit you when I have enough money.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.020
One more minute, okay?

23:06.540 --> 23:07.390
Do you miss me?

23:09.760 --> 23:11.300
Can't you say more?

23:12.580 --> 23:13.020
Don't we

23:13.020 --> 23:14.280
speak the same language?

23:14.700 --> 23:15.550
I'm now living on campus.

23:17.340 --> 23:18.950
I'm so torn.

23:19.410 --> 23:20.850
There are four people in our dorm.

23:21.370 --> 23:22.940
I don't know if I can get used to it.

23:24.790 --> 23:25.610
Oh no.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.340
My mum knows who you are.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.030
Recently,

23:29.740 --> 23:31.260
I can't answer the phone at home.

23:32.170 --> 23:32.950
Don't call me.

23:33.660 --> 23:34.340
Wait for my call.

23:37.470 --> 23:38.040
Lu Chen.

23:39.610 --> 23:40.120
Bye.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.480
It's winter.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.290
Why didn't you close the door and block the wind?

24:22.570 --> 24:23.700
Why are your eyes red?

24:23.720 --> 24:24.560
Did you quarrel with your dad?

24:25.220 --> 24:25.620
No.

24:27.540 --> 24:28.270
I recall the past.

24:29.460 --> 24:30.010
The past?

24:31.020 --> 24:32.950
Isn't your past all about Gui Xiao?

24:33.360 --> 24:34.070
What could you recall?

24:35.280 --> 24:37.160
Why did you break up?

24:37.570 --> 24:39.110
I still haven't figured it out yet.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.640
Look, when I broke up with Meng Xiaoshan,

24:41.700 --> 24:42.400
it's my fault.

24:43.110 --> 24:43.880
What about you two?

24:47.540 --> 24:47.950
It's my fault.

24:55.790 --> 24:56.410
At that time,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.060
she was a girl.

25:01.820 --> 25:02.700
She put all her emotions

25:02.700 --> 25:04.240
on the phone call.

25:07.140 --> 25:08.420
She couldn't see or touch them.

25:10.450 --> 25:11.070
How pitiful.

25:14.740 --> 25:15.620
Actually, during that period,

25:15.640 --> 25:16.400
when I couldn't see her,

25:17.900 --> 25:18.540
I missed her too.

25:19.980 --> 25:20.630
I missed her so much.

25:25.270 --> 25:26.710
Every time I hear her calling me Lu Chen,

25:28.670 --> 25:30.160
and calling my name on the phone,

25:33.040 --> 25:34.440
I feel that she has the most pleasant voice

25:34.470 --> 25:35.530
in the world.

25:38.550 --> 25:39.380
Every time.

25:40.950 --> 25:42.400
Enough. Stop it.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.900
You make me feel sad.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.930
Normally,

25:48.450 --> 25:49.630
she should have gotten married.

25:50.620 --> 25:51.720
Her children should be teens ages.

26:03.350 --> 26:04.070
Where are you going?

26:05.820 --> 26:06.260
Take a shower.

26:07.180 --> 26:08.860
Shower? It's Chinese New Year.

26:08.860 --> 26:09.900
There's no heater in your bathroom.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.000
Do you want to be frozen to death?

26:11.930 --> 26:13.970
I've even taken a bath in the snow in Qining.

26:15.430 --> 26:16.510
I'm not afraid of the cold.

26:17.980 --> 26:18.580
I'll fix the car.

26:24.380 --> 26:25.010
He dismantles the car

26:25.200 --> 26:26.650
every time he feels sad.

26:26.990 --> 26:28.090
It never changes.

26:32.660 --> 26:34.850
I came here with only one bag of stuff.

26:35.190 --> 26:36.140
But I'm leaving with this much.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
My dad will scold me.

26:39.210 --> 26:39.780
Not much at all.

26:40.740 --> 26:41.300
These are

26:41.300 --> 26:42.580
for you to wear

26:42.580 --> 26:43.160
in school later.

26:47.940 --> 26:48.980
You're going to see Uncle Lu soon.

26:49.610 --> 26:50.220
Are you happy?

26:50.550 --> 26:51.060
Yes.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.190
I wonder if the repair shop

26:58.210 --> 26:59.150
is still accommodable.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.280
What a waste.

27:04.180 --> 27:05.810
These slippers are so small.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.840
Who will wear them in the future?

27:08.600 --> 27:10.090
Little wordy. Let's go.

27:16.420 --> 27:16.940
Here.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.620
Aunt Gui Xiao, is this the place?

27:34.960 --> 27:35.440
We're here.

27:36.180 --> 27:36.650
Here we are.

27:40.590 --> 27:41.830
So spacious!

27:42.700 --> 27:44.450
It's larger than I thought.

27:56.470 --> 27:57.750
Hello, I'm looking for Lu Chen.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.080
Wait, miss.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.280
I'll make a call.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.820
It's cold outside. Come in first.

28:04.200 --> 28:04.970
Come on, kid.

28:05.940 --> 28:06.580
Okay, thank you.

28:07.420 --> 28:07.760
Let's go.

28:09.990 --> 28:12.110
Someone is looking for Lu Chen. At the door.

28:13.180 --> 28:15.170
A girl and a kid.

28:17.970 --> 28:19.390
Miss, he'll come out now.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.460
Does this factory all belong to Uncle Lu?

28:27.330 --> 28:28.600
Yes.

28:46.310 --> 28:47.030
Uncle Lu.

28:52.630 --> 28:53.270
Is it new-bought?

28:54.590 --> 28:56.040
He had too much stuff to fit.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.060
So I bought him a new one.

29:06.130 --> 29:06.930
I won't go in further.

29:13.860 --> 29:14.240
Come.

29:14.730 --> 29:15.940
Come inside and have a seat.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.220
Where is the toilet?

29:38.470 --> 29:38.830
The right side.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.090
It's cold in the factory.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.160
Don't take off your coat first.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.930
I'll leave after a few words.

30:28.590 --> 30:29.920
I've found a private school

30:29.940 --> 30:30.620
for Qin Xiaonan.

30:33.180 --> 30:34.260
I'll be away for a long time.

30:35.450 --> 30:36.540
But I'll ask my cousin

30:36.940 --> 30:38.090
to take you to school.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.460
I bought some clothes for him.

30:42.780 --> 30:43.580
From now on,

30:43.610 --> 30:45.100
you should also buy him some clothes every year.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.100
But not too many.

30:47.740 --> 30:48.710
He can wear school uniforms usually.

30:51.260 --> 30:52.730
That's all.

31:08.930 --> 31:09.660
Do you still love me?

31:27.330 --> 31:28.040
Bai Chao said that

31:29.460 --> 31:30.590
you were getting married.

31:49.870 --> 31:50.390
Lu Chen?

31:53.570 --> 31:53.900
Yes.

32:01.180 --> 32:01.820
When?

32:05.330 --> 32:05.970
Next month.

32:06.330 --> 32:08.430
♫Do you hear?♫

32:09.810 --> 32:12.550
♫Several years♫

32:11.220 --> 32:11.640
Congratulations.

32:13.200 --> 32:19.250
♫Ask from my soul over all desire♫

32:20.150 --> 32:22.250
♫Feel your heart♫

32:23.440 --> 32:25.680
♫Heal your wound♫

32:26.940 --> 32:33.210
♫Wait for your return, overcome the fear♫

32:37.910 --> 32:38.580
Aunt.

32:47.620 --> 32:48.740
Uncle Lu is getting married.

32:49.540 --> 32:50.300
He'll be quite busy.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.790
Remember

32:52.820 --> 32:53.860
what I told you in the car.

32:54.930 --> 32:55.370
Also,

32:56.420 --> 32:58.110
if you are neglected at school,

32:58.960 --> 33:00.170
remember what Aunt Gui Xiao said.

33:01.380 --> 33:01.940
All transfer students

33:01.940 --> 33:03.050
will go through this process.

33:03.780 --> 33:05.040
They'll accept you after a long time.

33:08.160 --> 33:08.910
Aunt.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.150
Go on with your work. I'm leaving.

33:18.260 --> 33:18.700
Wait.

33:29.180 --> 33:29.920
How much is the suitcase?

33:30.870 --> 33:31.340
One hundred.

33:42.980 --> 33:43.740
Here's for Xiaonan's clothes

33:44.810 --> 33:46.130
and his living cost of staying at your house for days.

33:47.940 --> 33:48.390
Thank you.

33:51.820 --> 33:52.360
Lu Chen.

33:53.210 --> 33:54.310
You don't have to be so calculative.

33:55.070 --> 33:56.340
You helped me in Qining.

33:56.950 --> 33:57.430
Lu Chen.

34:02.660 --> 34:04.110
Why are you not coming out? There're guests outside.

34:11.150 --> 34:11.510
You...

34:13.780 --> 34:15.300
You are...

34:17.300 --> 34:17.929
Gui Xiao.

34:18.860 --> 34:19.659
Do you still remember me?

34:19.940 --> 34:20.820
I'm Zhao Minshan from Class 2.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.100
Long time no see. You've been prettier.

34:26.120 --> 34:26.580
I nearly

34:26.600 --> 34:27.850
couldn't recognize you.

34:28.370 --> 34:28.940
Are you

34:28.940 --> 34:30.380
the friend Lu Chen's mother mentioned?

34:31.060 --> 34:32.340
I heard from Mrs Lu that

34:32.340 --> 34:33.530
he had a friend coming today.

34:33.699 --> 34:34.940
Since he has been outside

34:34.969 --> 34:35.710
all these years,

34:35.810 --> 34:36.650
I've never seen

34:36.670 --> 34:37.610
those of his friends.

34:37.870 --> 34:38.750
So I came out

34:38.780 --> 34:39.320
to have a look.

34:39.670 --> 34:40.710
I didn't expect that it was you.

34:40.739 --> 34:41.560
What a coincidence.

34:43.260 --> 34:43.900
Is this your kid?

34:45.590 --> 34:46.360
It's his comrade's.

34:46.909 --> 34:47.719
He asked me to go through the school procedure for him.

34:48.679 --> 34:49.800
Lu Chen never mentioned it.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.460
I've sent the kid here.

34:52.780 --> 34:53.500
I'm leaving first.

34:54.350 --> 34:55.020
Please don't go.

34:55.489 --> 34:56.690
Stay here and have lunch with us.

34:57.350 --> 34:58.540
Oh, Lu Chen.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.810
She came through a far way.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.960
How could you not invite her for a meal?

35:01.480 --> 35:02.000
No need.

35:02.820 --> 35:03.600
I have an appointment with Meng Xiaoshan.

35:05.060 --> 35:05.780
Meng Xiaoshan?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.370
Forget it, then.

35:35.860 --> 35:36.250
Girl.

35:36.370 --> 35:38.140
Why are you leaving now?

35:38.510 --> 35:39.580
I knew you were coming.

35:39.610 --> 35:41.060
So I went to buy fish for you.

35:42.100 --> 35:42.700
We'll see.

35:43.160 --> 35:43.890
Thank you.

35:44.150 --> 35:44.830
Girl, you...

35:44.860 --> 35:46.540
Why don't you eat first before you leave?

35:48.230 --> 35:49.100
Enough.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.090
Are you okay?

36:29.370 --> 36:30.350
Are you hurt?

36:30.660 --> 36:31.630
I'm fine.

36:40.860 --> 36:41.920
It's really broken here.

36:42.960 --> 36:43.870
Just repair it here.

36:44.390 --> 36:45.370
Anyone? Come over here.

36:45.780 --> 36:46.550
Take the job.

36:46.910 --> 36:47.530
No need.

36:47.650 --> 36:48.690
I can fix it myself.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.780
You can fix it here.

36:51.110 --> 36:51.550
No need.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.120
Excuse me.

36:53.140 --> 36:53.950
I have to reverse out.

36:54.170 --> 36:54.700
Thank you.

37:26.170 --> 37:28.180
There's no heater in your room.

37:34.190 --> 37:35.820
Your suitcase is expensive.

37:36.210 --> 37:36.660
Your parents are so willing to

37:36.700 --> 37:38.090
spend money on you.

37:47.650 --> 37:48.710
You have no conscience.

37:56.420 --> 37:57.150
Go and do your homework.

39:06.700 --> 39:07.780
Waive the bill for that table.

39:07.810 --> 39:08.390
Apologize properly.

39:09.210 --> 39:09.920
Hello, Gui Xiao.

39:13.820 --> 39:14.660
I'm hungry.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.290
Go to the lobby.

39:17.310 --> 39:18.140
I need to take this call.

39:20.050 --> 39:21.820
Gui Xiao, you sound like something's wrong.

39:22.670 --> 39:23.510
Did something happen at your home?

39:24.870 --> 39:25.710
Do you need money?

39:26.020 --> 39:26.790
I'll send it to you.

39:29.380 --> 39:29.820
No.

39:31.580 --> 39:32.560
I'm just hungry.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.490
I haven't eaten since morning.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.360
I was just passing by,

39:40.390 --> 39:41.420
and I thought of

39:41.440 --> 39:42.430
you mentioned buying me a meal.

39:44.900 --> 39:45.690
Where are you?

39:47.110 --> 39:47.830
By the river.

39:49.740 --> 39:50.360
The river?

39:51.100 --> 39:51.740
Which entrance?

39:55.420 --> 39:56.730
The intersection

39:58.160 --> 39:58.950
outside Lu Chen's factory.

40:02.220 --> 40:03.930
Are you here to pick me up?

40:04.650 --> 40:06.010
What are you doing? Put me down.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.340
I have something urgent to do.

40:07.940 --> 40:08.870
How old are you?

40:08.900 --> 40:10.250
Aren't you afraid of hurting your back?

40:54.530 --> 40:55.050
Did you cry?

41:04.370 --> 41:04.780
No.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.500
I just feel

41:11.570 --> 41:12.110
a little down.

41:16.100 --> 41:16.980
Because of Lu Chen, right?

41:25.080 --> 41:27.060
You two always came here for dating.

41:27.260 --> 41:28.250
Don't think I've forgotten.

41:30.010 --> 41:30.760
Let me take a guess.

41:32.730 --> 41:33.210
You are upset

41:33.230 --> 41:34.790
because of

41:34.820 --> 41:35.440
Lu Chen and Zhao Minshan.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.610
Everyone knows

41:42.640 --> 41:43.910
about Zhao Minshan's divorce.

41:44.180 --> 41:46.190
She was embarrassed and anxious to get married again.

41:47.260 --> 41:48.460
But after years of hard efforts,

41:49.060 --> 41:50.580
none of them can impress her.

41:51.370 --> 41:52.210
Finally,

41:52.250 --> 41:53.250
Lu Chen has fallen into her lap.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.420
So, a few days ago,

41:56.460 --> 41:57.980
since she got engaged to Lu Chen,

41:57.980 --> 41:58.910
and received the betrothal gifts,

41:59.140 --> 42:00.670
she was desperate to hold a grand banquet

42:00.700 --> 42:01.480
immediately.

42:02.340 --> 42:04.050
She has invited all her acquaintances in the neighbourhood.

42:07.270 --> 42:08.810
You. How old are you?

42:08.840 --> 42:10.750
Still crying for your first love who has been ten years ago?

42:11.600 --> 42:12.880
Don't blame me for scolding you, Gui Xiao.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.810
You thought you were still 18.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.500
There are many things you don't know.

42:18.850 --> 42:20.770
When I told Haidong to break up,

42:20.790 --> 42:22.280
we made it clean in the end.

42:23.780 --> 42:24.980
You should have cried enough

42:25.020 --> 42:26.580
when you broke up.

42:27.730 --> 42:28.810
Everyone has a first love.

42:29.110 --> 42:30.280
If you keep thinking about your first love,

42:30.580 --> 42:31.770
how are you supposed to move on?

42:39.620 --> 42:40.190
I'm hungry.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.280
Okay, let's eat something delicious.

42:43.720 --> 42:44.290
The most delicious one.

42:46.300 --> 42:46.980
Give me the car key.

42:49.850 --> 42:50.540
Where's your car?

42:51.410 --> 42:52.450
We're all acquaintances around here.

42:52.470 --> 42:53.110
I'm not afraid of losing it.

42:53.270 --> 42:54.140
I'll ask my husband

42:54.170 --> 42:54.840
to drive it back.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.230
It feels good.

43:10.650 --> 43:12.330
I can switch with you if you want.

43:13.420 --> 43:14.050
No need.

43:14.520 --> 43:16.050
You're already dying.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.200
How can I profit from your misfortunes?

43:21.230 --> 43:22.970
Who's dying?

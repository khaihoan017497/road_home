01:35.270 --> 01:37.770
[Episode 6]

01:41.840 --> 01:42.830
It feels good.

01:44.310 --> 01:45.990
I can switch with you if you want.

01:47.120 --> 01:47.740
No need.

01:48.190 --> 01:49.750
You're already dying.

01:50.370 --> 01:51.930
How can I profit from your misfortunes?

01:54.940 --> 01:56.600
Who's dying?

02:33.220 --> 02:34.079
Where are you going?

02:34.340 --> 02:35.620
Should I leave the door unlocked for you tonight?

02:37.680 --> 02:39.079
Look how anxious he is.

03:11.000 --> 03:11.430
Hello?

03:13.210 --> 03:14.380
I saw a car parked

03:14.380 --> 03:15.220
outside the repair factory.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.490
It looks familiar.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.610
Tell me the car plate number.

03:19.220 --> 03:20.760
Beijing Z52968.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.770
Isn't this Meng Xiaoshan's car?

03:24.740 --> 03:25.340
Was it stolen?

03:26.380 --> 03:27.510
Or she just parked it randomly?

03:28.350 --> 03:29.250
Let me call her.

03:30.650 --> 03:31.870
Give me Meng Xiaoshan's phone number.

03:32.320 --> 03:32.880
I'll call her.

03:33.260 --> 03:33.660
Okay.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.130
Gui Xiao, do you still care about him?

03:54.850 --> 03:55.590
I mean it.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.780
Let say

04:00.800 --> 04:01.440
without Zhao Minshan,

04:01.780 --> 04:02.480
what would you do?

04:05.410 --> 04:06.210
I don't want to talk about him.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.390
Stubborn.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.430
Did you renovate this place?

04:16.200 --> 04:16.579
Yes.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.079
Owning a restaurant needs to renovate frequently.

04:19.430 --> 04:20.589
Otherwise, if it's too run-down,

04:20.620 --> 04:21.540
it's not suitable for a banquet

04:21.560 --> 04:22.160
or a wedding dinner.

04:24.510 --> 04:25.230
What do you want to eat?

04:25.500 --> 04:26.100
Tell me.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.750
Lamb's spine.

04:30.590 --> 04:31.340
Fine.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.010
It's just that you will have a bad smell after eating.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.610
I'll take a shower at your place.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.140
Sure.

04:37.500 --> 04:37.980
Liu.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.430
Prepare the lamb spine with high-quality ingredients.

04:41.860 --> 04:42.300
Extreme spicy.

04:42.860 --> 04:43.170
Okay.

04:43.830 --> 04:44.190
Let's go.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.340
Do you want to eat or play?

04:55.030 --> 04:55.870
If you want to play,

04:55.900 --> 04:56.770
I'll turn off the fire for you.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.560
Take your time.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.690
I feel like I'm possessed.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.560
In Qining,

05:08.380 --> 05:09.820
my friend's car was stolen.

05:11.540 --> 05:12.460
I asked him for help.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.140
Later, those thieves

05:15.140 --> 05:15.860
came to take revenge.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.990
He taught them a lesson.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.120
So we got in touch.

05:24.570 --> 05:25.410
Did you make up?

05:28.050 --> 05:28.530
No.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.260
He asked me to deal with

05:32.260 --> 05:33.180
the transfer procedure for a kid.

05:34.570 --> 05:35.940
You know Lu Chen.

05:36.409 --> 05:37.409
He's always unbowed.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.450
He asked me for help.

05:42.060 --> 05:43.390
I thought he gave in

05:45.159 --> 05:46.140
and wanted to give us

05:46.140 --> 05:47.500
a chance to start over.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.180
I found out recently

05:55.020 --> 05:55.860
he's getting married.

06:03.770 --> 06:04.210
Liu.

06:04.780 --> 06:05.980
Serve a bottle of white liquor later.

06:05.980 --> 06:06.460
Wuliangye.

06:06.990 --> 06:07.600
Okay, boss.

06:08.900 --> 06:09.620
Where is my husband?

06:10.620 --> 06:11.740
He's still in the gathering.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.140
Ask him to come over

06:13.140 --> 06:13.830
after dinner.

06:13.860 --> 06:14.270
Okay.

06:15.910 --> 06:16.380
You're here.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.540
The car is parked by the river.

06:20.840 --> 06:21.620
After dinner,

06:21.620 --> 06:22.560
help me drive it back.

06:23.310 --> 06:24.550
Why is it stopped by the river?

06:27.380 --> 06:28.720
Gui Xiao is not feeling well.

06:28.810 --> 06:30.240
I helped her drive back.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.480
What happened?

06:34.350 --> 06:34.980
Was your sister

06:35.540 --> 06:36.420
bullied by others?

06:38.060 --> 06:38.820
Lu Chen.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.940
Lu Chen?

06:43.780 --> 06:44.659
They had a deep affection, didn't they?

06:45.440 --> 06:46.740
I just took her back

06:46.740 --> 06:47.340
by the river.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.220
I've been persuading her for a long time.

06:49.020 --> 06:49.860
I thought

06:49.890 --> 06:51.690
she was upset

06:51.690 --> 06:52.740
because she suddenly found out

06:52.740 --> 06:53.420
her first love was getting married

06:53.420 --> 06:54.210
with our old classmate.

06:55.030 --> 06:56.260
I didn't expect that

06:56.260 --> 06:56.990
they had met each other in Qining.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.300
It's really complicated.

07:02.470 --> 07:03.500
I can't make up my mind now.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.700
What mind?

07:06.990 --> 07:08.070
Just say what you should.

07:09.700 --> 07:10.340
Gui Xiao.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.380
You are almost 30 years old.

07:12.470 --> 07:13.560
In ancient times,

07:13.580 --> 07:15.000
you're considered to have been through half of your life.

07:16.180 --> 07:16.860
She's an adult.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.220
Yet you still treat her like a child.

07:21.340 --> 07:21.930
Fine.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.120
I won't be a parent anymore.

07:25.050 --> 07:25.540
Gui Xiao.

07:26.390 --> 07:27.550
I didn't tell you just now

07:27.780 --> 07:28.540
because I didn't want you to

07:28.540 --> 07:29.380
get involved in this.

07:30.620 --> 07:31.380
A few days ago,

07:31.380 --> 07:32.690
Haidong borrowed hundreds of thousands from me.

07:32.810 --> 07:33.740
Do you know who it is for?

07:37.220 --> 07:38.080
It's for Lu Chen.

07:42.570 --> 07:43.890
About two years ago,

07:44.080 --> 07:44.900
the repair factory of Lu Chen's father

07:44.900 --> 07:46.100
was not doing well.

07:46.220 --> 07:47.260
So he borrowed some money

07:47.260 --> 07:47.980
from Zhao Minshan's family

07:47.980 --> 07:48.900
to lubricate the relationships

07:49.500 --> 07:51.440
with the nearby car retail shops

07:51.470 --> 07:52.750
and insurance companies

07:52.770 --> 07:53.810
and expanded the repair factory.

07:54.570 --> 07:55.320
Only with that, the business was rejuvenated.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.140
At that time, Zhao Minshan's family

07:58.420 --> 07:59.950
wanted to become a shareholder and share the bonus.

08:00.340 --> 08:01.420
Lu Chen's father disagreed.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.170
Then, Zhao Minshan's family took the IOU

08:03.190 --> 08:04.100
and asked him to pay.

08:04.420 --> 08:05.380
Pay them both the principal and interest.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.940
This old man

08:08.210 --> 08:09.930
did nothing good in his life.

08:11.690 --> 08:12.890
Since he has borrowed the money,

08:13.160 --> 08:14.440
it's reasonable to pay back the money.

08:15.470 --> 08:16.380
But it should not and it's illegal

08:16.590 --> 08:17.980
to accept them as shareholders.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.630
Whether it's borrowing money or becoming a shareholder,

08:20.910 --> 08:22.020
it turns out to be a stalemate between them.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.050
It took a long time.

08:23.850 --> 08:24.920
before

08:25.620 --> 08:26.900
Zhao Minshan's parents

08:26.900 --> 08:28.390
came up with an idea.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.180
They suggested two families could be in-laws.

08:30.780 --> 08:32.340
As long as Lu Yanchen's father

08:32.360 --> 08:32.909
agreed,

08:33.289 --> 08:34.289
he didn't have to pay back the money.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.659
He could also spare the betrothal gift.

08:37.470 --> 08:39.140
Zhao Minshan agreed immediately

08:39.440 --> 08:40.350
after she heard the name of Lu Chen.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.510
That's how the marriage is formed.

08:44.179 --> 08:46.420
Did Lu Chen agree too?

08:46.740 --> 08:48.280
He didn't know it at all.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.140
He had been kept in the dark.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.430
His dad is indeed a dressed-up beast.

08:53.930 --> 08:55.740
Not only didn't he repay the loan, but he also didn't pay the bonus.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.580
He just mortgaged his own son

08:57.580 --> 08:59.280
to the lenders.

09:01.420 --> 09:02.770
After Lu Chen had known about this,

09:03.020 --> 09:04.100
he borrowed money

09:04.100 --> 09:05.580
from others immediately

09:06.260 --> 09:07.620
and asked a favour

09:07.620 --> 09:08.240
from many people to persuade the other

09:08.280 --> 09:09.000
to cancel the marriage.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.620
Honey, you continue.

09:15.620 --> 09:16.370
I'm thirsty.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.450
Lu Chen asked me to be the peacemaker.

09:22.180 --> 09:23.060
In my early years,

09:23.260 --> 09:24.510
I had some intercourse

09:25.100 --> 09:26.090
with Zhao Minshan's family.

09:26.450 --> 09:28.100
We did a lot of business together.

09:28.570 --> 09:29.990
So I avoided Lu Chen's family

09:30.500 --> 09:31.460
and talked to

09:32.700 --> 09:33.380
Zhao Minshan's family.

09:35.080 --> 09:35.800
They agreed.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.210
With two conditions.

09:37.300 --> 09:37.620
First,

09:38.180 --> 09:39.190
pay the one million yuan back.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.190
Second, Lu Chen has to find an excuse

09:41.210 --> 09:42.780
so that the Zhao family

09:43.320 --> 09:44.730
will not be embarrassed.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.990
Lu Chen

09:48.020 --> 09:48.580
didn't bargain at all.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.140
He said

09:50.860 --> 09:51.620
he didn't want the betrothal gift back

09:51.840 --> 09:53.720
but he would pay another 100,000 yuan to the Zhao family.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.910
Lu Chen, Zhao Minshan's parents

09:57.120 --> 09:58.760
and I

09:59.140 --> 09:59.860
discussed this matter together.

10:00.220 --> 10:03.220
I didn't involve Lu Chen's family

10:03.240 --> 10:04.700
and Zhao Minshan.

10:05.810 --> 10:06.620
Lu Chen and I also

10:06.620 --> 10:08.160
had a close relationship before.

10:08.530 --> 10:09.730
But this time,

10:09.940 --> 10:11.420
I'll be by your side.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.350
I've asked Haidong indirectly.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.290
If he clears the loan,

10:16.710 --> 10:17.380
his savings

10:17.400 --> 10:18.430
will be all gone.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.780
Moreover, 40,000 of the external debt is left.

10:23.770 --> 10:24.270
Gui Xiao.

10:25.090 --> 10:25.940
This time, the initiative

10:25.940 --> 10:26.820
is in your hands.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.180
Don't act impulsively.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.460
You have to think twice.

10:30.860 --> 10:31.740
Look at you.

10:31.740 --> 10:32.540
What are you doing?

10:32.540 --> 10:33.740
Who are you talking about?

10:35.120 --> 10:35.920
Forget it. Fine.

10:35.950 --> 10:36.750
I won't blame you.

10:38.990 --> 10:40.440
Lu Chen is a nice person.

10:40.890 --> 10:41.380
All these years,

10:41.380 --> 10:42.570
among these kids,

10:42.570 --> 10:43.900
I only favour him.

10:45.900 --> 10:48.380
How high a person will reach? It depends on opportunities.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.740
How far he will go? It depends on his moral quality.

10:51.490 --> 10:52.370
Don't throw Gui Xiao

10:52.390 --> 10:53.760
under the bus, okay?

10:54.620 --> 10:55.660
I don't even want to

10:55.660 --> 10:56.700
talk about the mess of his family.

10:58.730 --> 10:59.520
Be fair.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.630
Gui Xiao is perfect.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.860
Every jack has its jill.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.520
Who does Lu Chen think he is?

11:04.790 --> 11:06.910
He devoted himself

11:07.970 --> 11:09.620
and spent ten years

11:09.770 --> 11:10.980
protecting the country.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.080
Who do you think he is?

11:14.290 --> 11:16.170
Fine, I'll stop.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.390
But don't just compliment him.

11:18.420 --> 11:19.380
Let's be fair.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.200
If I don't say something,

11:22.270 --> 11:23.720
it'll be really unfair to him.

11:27.430 --> 11:28.780
Fine. By the way,

11:29.020 --> 11:30.070
marriage is a big deal.

11:31.170 --> 11:33.050
It's easy for girls to suffer losses.

11:34.490 --> 11:35.260
You should have deep consideration.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.410
That's all I said.

11:36.660 --> 11:37.340
I won't get involved.

11:42.780 --> 11:43.290
Gui Xiao.

11:44.840 --> 11:45.350
Never mind.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.220
I just

11:48.400 --> 11:49.100
suddenly thought of

11:49.100 --> 11:50.250
when I was in college,

11:52.320 --> 11:54.160
I only ate two buns every day.

12:26.470 --> 12:27.180
Apart from him,

12:31.310 --> 12:32.510
I haven't fallen in love with others.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.120
Not a single one.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.970
If we miss each other this time,

12:47.980 --> 12:49.020
I don't want to get married anymore.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.540
I can live as usual.

12:54.130 --> 12:55.620
Marriage is not a necessity.

12:56.840 --> 12:57.540
Isn't that

12:57.540 --> 12:58.430
how you've been through?

12:58.790 --> 12:59.910
That's why I advise you

13:01.180 --> 13:02.420
to be careful.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.300
Hello, who is this?

13:10.530 --> 13:11.130
I'm Lu Chen.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.140
Hold on.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.570
I'll go somewhere quiet.

13:17.590 --> 13:18.030
Hold on.

13:25.660 --> 13:26.140
What's up?

13:26.930 --> 13:28.100
Gui Xiao had a fight with me just now.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.460
She drove away from the repair factory.

13:31.860 --> 13:32.660
I was worried about her

13:33.320 --> 13:33.930
and I wanted to find her.

13:35.580 --> 13:36.730
I saw your car

13:37.900 --> 13:38.940
parked by the river.

13:40.410 --> 13:41.100
Is she at your place?

13:42.750 --> 13:43.430
Yes, she is.

13:45.180 --> 13:46.530
How did you bully her?

13:47.080 --> 13:47.800
Why is she crying?

13:49.460 --> 13:50.470
Don't play dumb.

13:56.130 --> 13:56.740
I thought...

13:57.430 --> 13:58.150
What did you think?

13:58.180 --> 13:58.890
You thought she didn't love you.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.100
If she doesn't love you,

14:01.100 --> 14:01.730
why would she

14:01.730 --> 14:02.900
travel so far to Qining?

14:08.020 --> 14:09.860
Yes, Qining has a beautiful view.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.100
Gui Xiao went there

14:11.120 --> 14:12.070
to enjoy the scenery

14:12.420 --> 14:13.580
and visit

14:13.580 --> 14:14.460
you, her first love.

14:15.770 --> 14:16.410
Where is she now?

14:17.430 --> 14:18.140
She's in my restaurant.

14:19.150 --> 14:19.950
Don't come over first.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.690
Think carefully about

14:22.860 --> 14:24.390
whether you want to start again.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.770
Think about your situation.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.070
And your parents.

14:29.340 --> 14:30.690
You are not teens anymore.

14:30.710 --> 14:31.840
You need to think about your family.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.910
Have a deep consideration before you come to her.

14:34.460 --> 14:35.710
She's not going home today anyway.

14:35.740 --> 14:36.380
She's either in my restaurant

14:36.420 --> 14:37.260
or at my home.

14:39.430 --> 14:40.040
I'm hanging up.

14:45.270 --> 14:46.260
You scared me.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.600
They love each other.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.180
Can you not interfere

14:50.210 --> 14:50.730
in their affair?

14:51.350 --> 14:52.340
I know.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.940
You don't know.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.500
When they broke up,

14:56.520 --> 14:57.790
both of them had a breakdown,

14:58.180 --> 14:59.050
just like they were dying.

15:00.420 --> 15:02.020
I'm afraid they would repeat the same mistake.

15:44.220 --> 15:45.210
Did you come to Beijing

15:45.530 --> 15:46.120
for the winter break?

15:46.850 --> 15:47.640
No.

15:48.070 --> 15:49.150
I transferred here to study

15:49.800 --> 15:50.640
and stay with Uncle Lu.

15:52.420 --> 15:52.980
Why?

15:53.980 --> 15:54.790
Because my dad

15:54.810 --> 15:56.230
is Uncle Lu's comrade.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.660
But he can't leave his son

15:58.660 --> 15:59.380
to stay here.

16:06.400 --> 16:06.840
Lu Chen.

16:08.480 --> 16:08.950
Lu Chen!

16:11.340 --> 16:12.420
I'm calling you. Didn't you hear me?

16:15.380 --> 16:15.930
What is it?

16:17.990 --> 16:18.630
That kid.

16:19.180 --> 16:20.530
He said he wanted to study in Beijing

16:20.660 --> 16:21.300
and stay at your house.

16:22.110 --> 16:22.460
Yes.

16:23.540 --> 16:24.140
I disagree.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.700
That's my own business.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.020
These are my cousin's clothes.

16:42.140 --> 16:43.350
You both wear the extra small size.

16:43.540 --> 16:44.220
It fits perfectly.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.960
I noticed you had renovated the outside.

16:48.420 --> 16:48.930
Yes.

16:49.330 --> 16:50.770
My parents thought the house was too run-down.

16:50.790 --> 16:52.280
They also thought I kept bothering them.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.980
So I asked my friend to make a design for

16:53.980 --> 16:54.740
the house and the yard.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.210
But it's not much different

17:08.240 --> 17:09.220
from the past.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.260
I really like the layout of your house

17:11.260 --> 17:11.990
with a yard.

17:12.849 --> 17:13.589
Are you jealous?

17:14.040 --> 17:15.869
This is the benefit of living outside the Fifth Ring.

17:16.420 --> 17:17.060
People like you,

17:17.060 --> 17:18.460
who rent a house in the city centre,

17:18.460 --> 17:19.380
can't live so freely.

17:23.619 --> 17:25.500
Do you still keep the pool table?

17:26.300 --> 17:27.260
Of course.

17:27.730 --> 17:29.060
This is the first gift

17:29.060 --> 17:29.820
my dad sent to me

17:30.060 --> 17:31.530
when I got into high school.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.750
Your dad was afraid that

17:33.780 --> 17:34.800
you hung out with Haidong.

17:36.090 --> 17:36.690
Yes.

17:37.370 --> 17:39.260
My dad is really good at scheming.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.820
Unfortunately, he didn't expect that

17:40.820 --> 17:41.960
I was the one who wanted to break up.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.150
I'll get some water.

17:44.180 --> 17:44.820
Set up the balls.

17:58.810 --> 17:59.250
Meng Xiaoshan.

18:04.550 --> 18:05.600
Why did you come here?

18:06.660 --> 18:07.430
I want to see her.

18:11.350 --> 18:12.560
It depends on whether she's willing or not.

18:16.390 --> 18:16.980
Ask her for me.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.360
OK. Wait here.

18:34.300 --> 18:34.970
Lu Chen is here.

18:35.820 --> 18:36.340
Do you want to see him?

18:40.610 --> 18:42.060
There are many eyes out there.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.830
After cancelling the marriage,

18:43.860 --> 18:44.940
it must be troublesome.

18:45.380 --> 18:46.340
If you want to talk,

18:46.340 --> 18:47.090
you can talk at my house.

18:48.050 --> 18:48.740
I let him in.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.460
What should I say?

18:52.580 --> 18:54.240
We were quite unhappy just now.

18:54.770 --> 18:55.880
It's so awkward to meet him.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.340
Listen, Gui Xiao.

18:58.340 --> 18:59.620
I didn't tell him.

18:59.840 --> 19:00.770
But he was smart.

19:01.420 --> 19:02.810
He saw an empty car

19:02.840 --> 19:03.910
at the intersection by the river.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.670
Then he asked who the car plate number was.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.420
Then he knew you were here.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.490
So you don't have to say anything.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.760
Just listen to him.

19:13.210 --> 19:13.970
I'll get him in.

19:29.930 --> 19:30.390
Go in.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.010
You two have a good talk.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.020
Thank you.

19:37.330 --> 19:37.810
Lu Chen.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.740
Be gentle with her.

19:40.770 --> 19:41.810
I'll only help you this time.

19:42.970 --> 19:43.400
Thank you.

19:48.570 --> 19:49.940
If you weren't handsome,

19:49.960 --> 19:51.230
and it's not for the sake of Gui Xiao,

19:51.360 --> 19:52.310
I wouldn't help you once.

19:56.380 --> 19:56.820
Kitty.

19:59.750 --> 20:00.060
Sit.

20:01.010 --> 20:01.360
Sit.

20:02.150 --> 20:02.480
Shake hands.

20:15.220 --> 20:15.740
Kitty.

20:17.100 --> 20:17.540
Kitty.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.540
Do you still remember him?

20:21.260 --> 20:22.110
The last time I saw you,

20:22.140 --> 20:23.240
a few months ago.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.130
You still remember

20:47.910 --> 20:53.470
♫When I first saw you, my heart was lost♫

20:49.940 --> 20:51.530
Things between Zhao Minshan and me are complicated.

20:53.190 --> 20:54.300
But it's not what you think.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.880
♫Thinking about the future♫

20:57.060 --> 20:57.620
I know.

20:57.510 --> 21:00.980
♫At the crossroads in the morning and evening♫

21:01.180 --> 21:01.940
Looks like Qin Feng

21:02.870 --> 21:03.550
has confessed

21:04.410 --> 21:10.240
♫I've been alone for a long time♫

21:04.540 --> 21:05.740
what he should and shouldn't.

21:10.830 --> 21:14.370
♫Through the dusty years♫

21:15.390 --> 21:19.360
♫Still waiting in the same place♫

21:20.160 --> 21:26.860
♫Be brave and say what you feel♫

21:22.630 --> 21:23.070
Gui Xiao.

21:24.970 --> 21:25.780
Spare me some time.

21:27.780 --> 21:34.280
♫I'll never let you down again♫

21:34.020 --> 21:34.510
I'll finish it quickly,

21:35.270 --> 21:37.320
♫Close your eyes and get closer♫

21:36.400 --> 21:36.870
very quickly.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.340
♫Feel your temperature♫

21:39.440 --> 21:40.990
♫In your world♫

21:40.990 --> 21:43.260
♫I don't want to back out♫

21:43.980 --> 21:45.430
♫You're warm♫

21:45.430 --> 21:50.790
♫I'm not alone anymore♫

21:51.660 --> 21:53.570
♫Our reunion♫

21:53.720 --> 21:55.520
♫But back to the beginning♫

21:55.300 --> 21:56.620
Xiaonan is still in the repair factory.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.210
♫It's like this moment♫

21:57.210 --> 21:59.500
♫Youth doesn't end♫

21:57.560 --> 21:58.050
Well...

21:59.220 --> 22:00.060
You should go back first.

22:00.230 --> 22:01.960
♫I'm still in love with you♫

22:00.750 --> 22:01.890
What if your dad goes again?

22:01.960 --> 22:07.060
♫My heart is pulling towards the way back home♫

22:04.290 --> 22:04.820
I'm leaving.

22:33.750 --> 22:34.900
What did he say to you?

22:38.700 --> 22:39.420
He said

22:40.740 --> 22:41.930
the problem would be solved soon.

22:43.750 --> 22:44.360
That's all?

22:49.580 --> 22:50.710
What is his feeling for you?

22:51.380 --> 22:52.110
Does he want to make up?

22:55.010 --> 22:56.270
He didn't say.

22:57.970 --> 22:58.820
But now,

22:58.840 --> 23:00.080
he can't say that.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.740
Anyway, he's going to get married.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.460
Make it up if you break it.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.450
Fine.

23:28.530 --> 23:29.370
How many hours has it been?

23:29.640 --> 23:30.180
You haven't cooled down yet.

23:48.450 --> 23:48.950
Qin Xiaonan.

23:49.780 --> 23:50.660
Did Gui Xiao

23:50.660 --> 23:51.720
drug you with ecstasy?

23:52.340 --> 23:53.480
We've known each other for years.

23:53.740 --> 23:54.940
She only accompanied you for a few days.

23:56.930 --> 23:57.700
I like her.

24:01.900 --> 24:02.940
I like her!

24:03.760 --> 24:05.510
I want to cry when I see her cry.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.770
Aunt Gui Xiao treats me well.

24:09.140 --> 24:10.200
She even helped me find a school.

24:11.090 --> 24:11.740
Uncle Lu,

24:12.500 --> 24:13.950
there's really something wrong with you.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.200
Let's not talk about

24:18.230 --> 24:18.970
my personality first.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.660
We can discuss it later.

24:21.020 --> 24:21.790
But

24:21.820 --> 24:23.140
you liking my wife

24:23.440 --> 24:24.160
is a very serious crime.

24:24.980 --> 24:25.700
If you do it again,

24:25.730 --> 24:26.440
I'll kick you back.

24:26.860 --> 24:27.500
Do you hear me?

24:33.750 --> 24:34.630
Did Aunt Gui Xiao buy it for you?

24:38.750 --> 24:39.740
It's a gift for the Spring Festival.

24:45.340 --> 24:47.010
You just said

24:48.770 --> 24:50.430
you went to find Aunt Gui Xiao this afternoon.

24:50.840 --> 24:51.590
Is that true?

24:53.540 --> 24:54.880
Mind your own business.

24:56.730 --> 24:57.330
Where are you going?

24:57.510 --> 24:57.940
To cook.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.230
You're so frugal.

25:09.860 --> 25:10.420
We're only two people.

25:10.980 --> 25:11.650
How much more do you want?

25:12.300 --> 25:13.200
I'm also here.

25:13.260 --> 25:14.560
I came here hungry.

25:14.940 --> 25:15.650
Who asked you to come?

25:16.550 --> 25:17.820
You called me and inquire about Meng Xiaoshan.

25:17.820 --> 25:18.620
How could I not come?

25:18.700 --> 25:19.500
That was my first love.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.190
Whose child is this?

25:23.390 --> 25:24.190
Is it yours?

25:25.260 --> 25:26.220
My dad is Uncle Lu's

25:26.220 --> 25:27.060
comrade.

25:28.120 --> 25:28.940
Uncle Lu

25:28.940 --> 25:30.470
can only have one comrade.

25:30.540 --> 25:31.460
That's me.

25:32.160 --> 25:32.920
Behave yourself.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.460
I'm glad to see you.

25:35.350 --> 25:36.720
When are you going to report yourself to the new unit?

25:37.660 --> 25:38.330
Tomorrow.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.330
Then you can't drink, right?

25:44.210 --> 25:44.530
Okay.

25:47.350 --> 25:47.880
Have some food.

25:49.360 --> 25:49.670
Here.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.580
Ask Uncle Liu

25:54.710 --> 25:56.130
to bring a bowl of peanuts here.

26:03.290 --> 26:04.470
How was the talk with Gui Xiao?

26:04.910 --> 26:05.790
Did you explain clearly to her?

26:07.230 --> 26:07.690
Almost.

26:08.580 --> 26:09.700
What do you mean by almost?

26:12.420 --> 26:13.170

If you deposit the money,

26:27.330 --> 26:28.220
you will gain interest.

No.

Do you know

26:43.260 --> 26:43.800
the brand of this suitcase?

26:44.530 --> 26:45.370
It must be expensive.

26:46.550 --> 26:47.020
Yes.

26:47.420 --> 26:48.230
It's expensive.

get him a basin.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.420

27:51.940 --> 27:52.910
for me being a SWAT's family member.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.380
You don't need to remind me.

That's right.

29:58.140 --> 29:59.110
It's more famous than me.

29:59.950 --> 30:00.630

Are the new members here?

30:32.920 --> 30:33.250
Yes.

30:33.660 --> 30:34.140
What a coincidence.

30:34.420 --> 30:35.240
They arrived the same day as Captain Lu.

30:40.060 --> 30:40.380
Yes.

30:47.210 --> 30:48.090
I'll introduce them later.

The 12 new members

30:51.020 --> 30:51.910
are newly assigned.

Normally, how many people

30:54.710 --> 30:55.370
in a group?

30:55.920 --> 30:56.790
Usually, five or six people are in a group.

That's how they group

30:58.020 --> 30:58.660

Where is Mr Wu?

31:28.700 --> 31:29.260
I have no idea.

31:30.820 --> 31:32.260
Didn't we make an appointment at this time?

31:32.860 --> 31:34.210
The flight is at 12:00 p.m..

31:34.540 --> 31:34.940
It's still early.

31:39.150 --> 31:39.630
Sorry.

31:39.660 --> 31:40.540
I'm late for buying breakfast.

31:41.420 --> 31:42.780
Boss, you're too greedy.

31:43.330 --> 31:44.300
No, I've eaten.

31:44.300 --> 31:45.150
This is for you.

31:45.740 --> 31:46.540
Thank you.

31:46.570 --> 31:47.210
Let's go.

31:50.940 --> 31:51.850
You are new members.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.390
I'm the new captain.

31:55.380 --> 31:56.420
As the saying goes,

31:56.420 --> 31:57.140
ring out the old, ring in the new.

31:57.980 --> 31:59.180
It's a fate

31:59.180 --> 31:59.970
for us to report here

32:00.240 --> 32:00.970
in the last week

32:01.790 --> 32:02.750
before the Spring Festival.

32:03.790 --> 32:04.790
That means we can celebrate the Spring Festival together.

32:08.140 --> 32:08.860
It's our first meeting.

32:09.530 --> 32:10.260
You don't have to be so serious.

32:11.590 --> 32:12.370
You are allowed to talk.

32:12.900 --> 32:13.490
Captain Lu.

32:13.660 --> 32:14.860
Will you treat us to dinner during the Spring Festival?

32:15.660 --> 32:15.980
Sure.

32:17.380 --> 32:17.990
Let's have dinner together on New Year's Eve.

32:18.350 --> 32:19.310
Thank you, Captain Lu.

32:21.170 --> 32:21.840
After the introduction,

32:21.990 --> 32:22.980
and also being exploited by you,

32:23.610 --> 32:24.300
now let's get back to business.

32:26.500 --> 32:26.940
Stand at ease.

32:27.900 --> 32:28.340
Attention!

32:29.590 --> 32:30.470
Before you came,

32:31.400 --> 32:32.590
you were all top-grade students in the police academy.

32:34.090 --> 32:35.260
The EOD

32:35.830 --> 32:37.140
requires practical

32:37.820 --> 32:38.620
and professional skills.

32:39.270 --> 32:39.910
In the police academy,

32:40.760 --> 32:41.920
you don't learn in a specialized way.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.100
Just like what you are now.

32:45.700 --> 32:46.290
But as you reach here,

32:47.180 --> 32:47.900
the instructor

32:47.900 --> 32:48.980
will teach you by hand.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.360
Those with good qualifications

32:51.110 --> 32:51.810
can become junior EOD technicians

32:52.620 --> 32:53.620
after a three-year training.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.230
In three to five years of practice,

32:57.000 --> 32:57.990
they can become senior EOD technicians.

32:58.740 --> 33:00.020
That is, an EOD expert.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.020
The biggest difference

33:04.030 --> 33:04.830
between EOD and other professions

33:05.510 --> 33:07.100
is that we can only succeed

33:07.670 --> 33:08.280
and not fail.

33:09.300 --> 33:10.380
Not even a single mistake

33:10.920 --> 33:11.840
is allowed.

33:12.470 --> 33:13.540
Although we have EOD suits,

33:14.640 --> 33:15.860
it can only block

33:15.980 --> 33:16.780
the TNT explosion

33:16.800 --> 33:18.040
in less than one kilogram.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.290
And it has to be three meters away.

33:22.740 --> 33:23.510
In other words,

33:23.860 --> 33:24.780
if the dosage is a little,

33:25.760 --> 33:27.040
you are lucky to have your dead body left.

33:28.220 --> 33:28.930
If it is a large dose,

33:31.050 --> 33:32.120
there's nothing left.

33:38.470 --> 33:38.910
Are you scared?

33:43.310 --> 33:43.990
It's our first meeting.

33:44.580 --> 33:45.460
You are allowed to talk.

33:46.330 --> 33:47.000
Of course not.

33:47.940 --> 33:49.210
This is our profession.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.440
Yes, Captain Lu.

33:50.470 --> 33:51.750
This is what we do.

33:54.260 --> 33:54.620
Alright.

33:55.370 --> 33:56.010
I'm done with the nagging.

33:57.050 --> 33:57.780
One more.

33:58.260 --> 33:59.460
I want to tell you personally.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.540
When I joined the team,

34:02.380 --> 34:02.920
the old captain

34:03.370 --> 34:04.650
gave us a motto.

34:06.220 --> 34:07.260
Hope you can find

34:07.260 --> 34:08.159
the sentence you want to write

34:09.360 --> 34:10.909
at the end of your last letters.

34:11.790 --> 34:12.400
It's very motivating.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.940
What did Captain Lu say?

34:15.850 --> 34:17.239
Thousands of firecrackers and thousands of blood.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.020
Every inch of land is valuable as gold.

34:20.820 --> 34:21.610
I'll take this line.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.179
Is there anything new, Captain Lu?

34:23.620 --> 34:24.080
Yes.

34:24.100 --> 34:24.880
Tell us more.

34:25.100 --> 34:26.000
There are so many of us.

34:26.219 --> 34:27.310
We don't have enough last words.

34:27.540 --> 34:28.820
It's hard to lead a team now.

34:29.449 --> 34:30.570
I even have to provide them with multiple choices for their last words.

34:33.350 --> 34:33.780
Stand at ease.

34:35.179 --> 34:35.580
Attention!

34:37.080 --> 34:37.679
Two sentences.

34:38.219 --> 34:38.780
But same meaning.

34:40.330 --> 34:41.460
I hope you will never use them.

34:42.460 --> 34:43.630
I shall dedicate myself to the interests of the country in life and death

34:44.560 --> 34:46.090
irrespective of personal weal and woe.

34:47.340 --> 34:47.780
Or

34:49.159 --> 34:50.120
I'll sacrifice my life for the nation

34:50.980 --> 34:52.420
and regard death as a return.

34:54.489 --> 34:55.690
Form the EOD groups

34:56.270 --> 34:57.570
with three members in each

34:57.990 --> 34:59.610
in alphabetical order by initials.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.550
See you in the field in three minutes.

35:01.780 --> 35:02.080
Yes.

35:03.140 --> 35:03.460
Leader Xu.

35:04.140 --> 35:04.620
This is the list.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.020
You are responsible for grouping quickly.

35:06.260 --> 35:06.900
Go to the field now.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.170
Descend quickly.

35:13.180 --> 35:14.060
Change into the EOD suit

35:14.930 --> 35:16.140
and practice going up the stairs quickly.

35:16.770 --> 35:17.650
And come back to me.

35:18.170 --> 35:18.570
Sir.

35:19.900 --> 35:20.900
Isn't there a time limit?

35:21.180 --> 35:21.710
Not today.

35:22.860 --> 35:23.580
I want to

35:23.580 --> 35:24.260
examine your physical fitness

35:26.070 --> 35:26.800
and record them.

35:28.020 --> 35:29.660
It would be the first stroke

35:29.660 --> 35:30.370
you leave at the training base today.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.870
This is stricter than the usual requirements.

35:37.000 --> 35:37.840
The last place

35:38.100 --> 35:39.460
will clean all the EOD suits worn today.

35:43.180 --> 35:43.550
Action!

36:40.100 --> 36:40.950
The suits are heavy.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.210
EOD suits

36:42.370 --> 36:43.090
are more than 35 kilograms.

36:43.300 --> 36:43.860
Just get used to it.

38:05.820 --> 38:06.310
Cut it.

38:24.850 --> 38:25.340
No way.

38:25.730 --> 38:26.660
My hands are trembling.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.080
In critical moments,

38:30.950 --> 38:32.270
you will be exhausted and sweated all over.

38:32.700 --> 38:33.660
You will even face

38:33.660 --> 38:34.560
attack, shooting,

38:34.750 --> 38:35.530
and gunfire.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.700
But your fingers

38:37.240 --> 38:38.080
must be the steadiest.

38:39.100 --> 38:39.900
This is the first time

38:39.930 --> 38:40.690
you wear EOD suits

38:41.460 --> 38:42.340
and go upstairs quickly.

38:43.140 --> 38:43.580
From now on,

38:44.180 --> 38:44.900
you have training

38:44.900 --> 38:46.230
of wearing EOD suits and overcoming obstacles,

38:46.730 --> 38:47.540
stairs, short walls,

38:47.940 --> 38:48.780
holes, narrow passages,

38:49.220 --> 38:50.180
dark room, and others.

38:50.690 --> 38:52.120
You have to overcome all obstacles

38:52.540 --> 38:53.540
and get to the bomb.

38:54.240 --> 38:54.800
And your hands

38:55.700 --> 38:56.450
still have to be steady.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.520
This is your class schedule.

39:09.460 --> 39:11.070
The morning session is the basic training

39:11.100 --> 39:11.740
for the SWAT detachment,

39:12.210 --> 39:13.450
including physical and shooting.

39:14.860 --> 39:15.970
During the afternoon, you will have EOD training.

39:16.580 --> 39:17.840
Although I'm your instructor,

39:18.260 --> 39:19.220
I have to work on missions

39:19.540 --> 39:20.160
and be on duty.

39:20.230 --> 39:21.130
I have my own job.

39:21.490 --> 39:22.770
I can't be at the base at any time.

39:24.460 --> 39:25.160
Now we have

39:25.460 --> 39:26.900
five EOD instructors.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.720
I'm mainly responsible

39:28.970 --> 39:30.220
for the combat exercises with robots

39:30.650 --> 39:32.010
and making and dismantling explosive devices.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.180
Not only do we have to learn about dismantling,

39:34.860 --> 39:35.460
but we also have to learn about making?

39:36.630 --> 39:38.260
All the explosives devices in the base

39:38.690 --> 39:39.770
are basically made by the former trainee

39:39.850 --> 39:41.000
and instructors.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.500
If you don't know how to make it

39:43.930 --> 39:44.730
and also the principle,

39:45.330 --> 39:46.360
how could you know how to dismantle it?

39:55.180 --> 39:56.000
Don't you go home this weekend?

39:57.870 --> 39:58.270
Bye.

40:03.940 --> 40:04.380
Captain Lu.

40:05.120 --> 40:05.690
Captain Lu.

40:05.710 --> 40:06.550
You forgot something.

40:06.970 --> 40:07.770
I just made it

40:08.050 --> 40:08.720
for you to dismantle.

40:12.380 --> 40:13.080
No explosives.

40:13.450 --> 40:14.000
Don't worry.

40:30.860 --> 40:32.180
Lu Chen is back.

40:35.230 --> 40:36.460
You came back

40:36.500 --> 40:38.530
to get married after New Year, didn't you?

40:40.010 --> 40:40.370
No.

40:41.370 --> 40:42.320
It's a normal work transfer.

40:47.590 --> 40:48.230
That's all.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.090
Chinese New Year is around the corner. That's too little.

40:52.460 --> 40:54.290
You will need those at your father-in-law's house.

41:00.020 --> 41:00.860
Two more boxes of this.

41:01.490 --> 41:01.930
Okay.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.380
Why do you buy so many

41:09.380 --> 41:10.400
with only a kid and you are here?

41:10.650 --> 41:11.290
I bought them for you.

41:12.020 --> 41:13.500
Why are you wasting money?

41:13.520 --> 41:14.690
I have food at home.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.440
It's New Year.

41:15.860 --> 41:16.860
It's reasonable

41:16.880 --> 41:17.220
for a brother to buy something for his sister.

41:18.050 --> 41:18.540
Besides,

41:19.030 --> 41:19.800
our parents don't care about you.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.150
As your brother,

41:21.180 --> 41:21.950
If I don't do anything,

41:22.420 --> 41:23.020
people will gossip.

41:30.230 --> 41:31.420
The password is your birthday.

41:31.540 --> 41:33.300
It's just that I don't have much money.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.180
I've only saved 20,000 after I get married.

41:37.250 --> 41:37.650
No need.

41:39.410 --> 41:40.690
Your brother-in-law knows about it.

41:41.170 --> 41:43.180
And the money is not for you.

41:43.410 --> 41:44.730
You have to give it back to me

41:44.770 --> 41:45.410
when you get better.

41:46.510 --> 41:46.980
No need.

41:48.570 --> 41:49.690
As long as you live a good life,

41:50.260 --> 41:51.690
I can solve my own problem.

41:52.180 --> 41:52.870
You are my brother...

41:58.730 --> 41:59.330
Come and eat.

42:00.120 --> 42:00.520
Let's eat.

42:14.970 --> 42:17.170
Mum said Zhao Minshan came over to our house

42:17.210 --> 42:17.910
and cried loudly.

42:18.260 --> 42:19.060
Dad was so angry.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.760
Did dad come to you?

42:21.600 --> 42:22.370
I have an appointment

42:22.860 --> 42:23.380
with them.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.640
Why didn't you tell me?

42:26.570 --> 42:27.690
Drive back. I'll accompany you.

42:29.060 --> 42:30.690
Dad treats you not better than treating me,

42:31.140 --> 42:31.870
even worse.

42:32.570 --> 42:33.100
If you go,

42:33.730 --> 42:34.870
do you still want to go home?

42:35.420 --> 42:37.110
But what if you go there, and Dad hit you?

42:37.460 --> 42:37.860
He won't.

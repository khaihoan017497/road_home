[Episode 10]

01:47.979 --> 01:48.300
Dad.

01:51.190 --> 01:51.870
I'm at the airport.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.580
My dad is here.

02:10.770 --> 02:12.410
Your legendary dad?

02:14.340 --> 02:15.340
Come with me.

02:16.340 --> 02:16.940
If you are around too,

02:16.940 --> 02:17.750
he would let me go earlier.

02:19.410 --> 02:20.530
What should I say

02:20.620 --> 02:21.520
when I see your day?

02:22.710 --> 02:23.820
Just sit far away

02:23.860 --> 02:24.940
and pretend that

02:24.960 --> 02:26.310
you're in a hurry to catch the plane.

02:27.230 --> 02:27.510
Go.

02:34.860 --> 02:35.340
Xiao.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.040
This is my colleague, Duan Rou.

02:38.500 --> 02:38.930
Hello, uncle.

02:39.320 --> 02:39.860
Hello.

02:40.700 --> 02:41.660
You guys go ahead,

02:41.820 --> 02:42.660
I'll wait over there.

02:45.860 --> 02:46.180
Have a seat.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.660
You're on a business trip?

02:53.210 --> 02:54.540
I'm attending a conference in Sanya.

02:55.370 --> 02:55.900
Where are you going?

02:58.050 --> 02:58.980
I’m going to Anhui

02:59.200 --> 03:00.450
for an alternative energy project.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.000
Alternative energy has been

03:04.880 --> 03:05.760
on the rise in recent years.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.290
The direction you chose is good.

03:12.200 --> 03:12.860
Do you...

03:14.770 --> 03:16.250
have any plans to purchase an apartment?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.190
I can provide you with some monetary aid.

03:19.510 --> 03:19.980
No.

03:20.640 --> 03:21.920
The loft I rent is enough for me.

03:22.450 --> 03:24.110
My company gives subsidies for rent too.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.790
Move into somewhere with a better location.

03:35.190 --> 03:36.050
I can help you with the rent.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.560
No need.

03:37.940 --> 03:39.300
The place I'm staying at is good enough.

03:39.730 --> 03:40.690
It's near to my office too.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.020
Right.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.220
It's close to your office.

03:49.660 --> 03:50.620
You've used

03:50.640 --> 03:51.829
your car for a few years now, right?

03:54.020 --> 03:54.700
Why not get a new one?

03:56.730 --> 03:57.380
I have already

03:57.380 --> 03:58.680
bought a new car recently.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.040
I drive both my new car and my old car interchangeably.

04:02.630 --> 04:03.020
Good.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.740
Take me away.

04:20.700 --> 04:21.100
Hello?

04:22.420 --> 04:22.790
Yes.

04:23.540 --> 04:24.450
We're together.

04:25.660 --> 04:26.510
Sure, sure.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.460
You have a phone call, Gui Xiao.

04:29.940 --> 04:30.540
Now?

04:30.900 --> 04:31.460
It's urgent.

04:37.909 --> 04:38.690
Hello? Give me a moment.

04:39.260 --> 04:40.550
Dad, I have to tend to this.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.180
I'll go first

04:41.200 --> 04:42.250
and board the plane directly afterwards.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.080
Goodbye, uncle.

04:46.080 --> 04:46.930
Go ahead.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.420
Why do you always want to run away when you see your dad?

05:02.560 --> 05:03.240
I have nothing to say.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.180
What were you talking about?

05:05.660 --> 05:06.810
It was as serious as a meeting.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.410
He wants to buy me a car and a house.

05:09.430 --> 05:10.910
I said I don't need it. I have them.

05:12.820 --> 05:14.700
Who would think they have too many houses and cars?

05:16.060 --> 05:17.220
I can earn it myself.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.200
I don't need him.

05:23.750 --> 05:24.960
We're not boarding till a little later,

05:25.040 --> 05:26.000
why turn off your phone now?

05:27.510 --> 05:28.630
I need to read this thick stack

05:28.660 --> 05:29.450
of documents.

05:30.020 --> 05:30.900
I'm more at peace with my phone turned off.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.100
Besides,

05:32.100 --> 05:33.020
if there's anything urgent, they'd look for you.

05:34.450 --> 05:35.530
What if your boyfriend contacts you?

05:37.280 --> 05:38.300
He can't use communication devices

05:38.320 --> 05:40.300
during this period of time.

05:40.980 --> 05:41.720
He can only contact me

05:41.860 --> 05:43.180
through psychic powers.

05:44.260 --> 05:44.950
What is he doing?

05:45.390 --> 05:46.060
It's a secret.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.240
My sister is a SWAT.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.780
My family would never asked her about it

05:52.810 --> 05:53.740
and she never told us either.

05:54.610 --> 05:56.000
As long as it's related to work,

05:56.300 --> 05:57.050
she can't talk about it.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.110
She can't say what mission it is.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.820
She can't say when she will be back.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.010
She can't even talk about when she

06:04.220 --> 06:05.260
injured herself or

06:05.300 --> 06:05.950
when she made an achievement.

06:06.510 --> 06:07.780
In any case, she'd just say,

06:08.020 --> 06:08.580
"I have a mission,"

06:09.240 --> 06:09.960
and leave immediately.

06:11.460 --> 06:12.370
Nameless Hero

06:13.650 --> 06:14.580
and their family members.

06:25.010 --> 06:25.420
Attention!

06:26.510 --> 06:26.990
At ease.

06:28.310 --> 06:29.270
It's a new year.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.340
Everyone seem to

06:31.980 --> 06:33.020
look good.

06:36.409 --> 06:37.340
This Chinese New Year,

06:38.440 --> 06:40.690
Captain Lin and I have come together

06:41.940 --> 06:43.580
to bring you a big gift.

06:44.310 --> 06:45.240
This gift

06:46.000 --> 06:47.650
is a competition with

06:48.270 --> 06:49.610
with Zhangyan SWAT.

06:49.960 --> 06:50.960
Thank you, Captain Lu.

06:50.990 --> 06:51.830
Thank you, Captain Lin.

06:52.340 --> 06:54.159
First Squadron, Second Squadron will participate in the competition.

06:54.909 --> 06:57.050
All new members will observe.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.040
Sir.

06:58.350 --> 06:58.780
Go ahead.

06:59.490 --> 07:00.370
When does it start?

07:00.430 --> 07:00.870
Tomorrow.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.100
The competition is divided into four major parts.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.700
Comprehensive skills test includes

07:08.220 --> 07:10.020
five kilometer run, crawling,

07:10.730 --> 07:13.430
climbing, and sliding, with weights.

07:14.370 --> 07:15.250
Driving test includes

07:15.640 --> 07:17.340
driving the bomb squad vehicle

07:17.800 --> 07:19.570
and the 13.5 ton armored vehicle.

07:19.860 --> 07:20.650
Shooting test includes

07:21.020 --> 07:23.100

07:23.450 --> 07:24.580
as well as

07:24.610 --> 07:25.790

07:26.570 --> 07:27.940
territory snatching shooting,

07:28.250 --> 07:29.060
and shooting while running with a sniper.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.520
Finally it's the individual combat.

07:31.790 --> 07:32.560
Which includes language test

07:32.780 --> 07:33.700
and drones operation.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.080
Let me emphasize one point.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.420
Captain Lu and I are the

07:37.470 --> 07:38.710
conductor of the language test.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.260
Bring it on

07:40.260 --> 07:41.220
if you are skilled in

07:41.530 --> 07:42.290
any minority language.

07:42.820 --> 07:43.710
Captain Lu can understand it all.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.800
For a mission, Captain Lu

07:47.240 --> 07:48.260
mastered three languages

07:48.260 --> 07:48.950
in two years.

07:49.580 --> 07:50.490
As for the rest,

07:50.820 --> 07:52.580
they will be on-site judgment and mental strength,

07:53.620 --> 07:54.300
which will be evaluated

07:54.300 --> 07:55.290
during the combat practice tomorrow.

07:56.790 --> 07:57.850
Any questions?

07:57.940 --> 07:58.450
Sir.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.100
Speak.

07:59.860 --> 08:00.780
Will Captain Lu be joining too?

08:01.000 --> 08:01.400
Of course.

08:02.130 --> 08:02.980
As the captain,

08:03.240 --> 08:04.110
you should perform better than us.

08:05.300 --> 08:05.720
Of course.

13:15.270 --> 13:16.480
I almost can't see the target.

13:45.010 --> 13:46.070
Captain Lu hit all the targets.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.570
Captain Du missed one.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.180
Our team's gun champion has been overtaken.

13:56.090 --> 13:56.750
I concede.

14:02.910 --> 14:03.310
Captain Lu.

14:04.040 --> 14:04.840
Why did you choose the bomb squad?

14:07.320 --> 14:07.960
Because

14:08.920 --> 14:09.490
it's more dangerous.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.610
Someone has to do it.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.080
Right?

14:19.210 --> 14:19.670
What about you?

14:20.340 --> 14:20.870
Me?

14:22.230 --> 14:23.510
I studied security management at the Police Academy.

14:24.460 --> 14:25.500
After my internship following my graduation,

14:26.070 --> 14:26.890
I was being assigned.

14:28.010 --> 14:29.330
My leader asked me to choose.

14:29.650 --> 14:30.090
I said,

14:30.900 --> 14:31.710
I'll do as you say.

14:34.210 --> 14:34.690
Good boy.

14:39.490 --> 14:40.850
It's been a while since I first started.

14:41.620 --> 14:42.820
I just graduated then.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.540
We had 40 classmates.

14:47.110 --> 14:48.150
One of them had sacrificed.

14:49.390 --> 14:50.310
There are also three who are severely injured and disabled.

14:52.400 --> 14:52.920
Do you have any more?

14:55.540 --> 14:55.850
Yes.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.170
Follow me to the meeting room

14:58.620 --> 14:59.470
and write the evaluation report.

14:59.740 --> 15:00.100
I'll make sure you'll have enough.

15:07.000 --> 15:07.460
Rise.

15:08.940 --> 15:09.410
Captain.

15:09.940 --> 15:10.680
Where's Captain Lu?

15:11.310 --> 15:12.170
As usual,

15:12.680 --> 15:14.270
whoever has the highest position will go first.

15:26.230 --> 15:27.590
Who made this bomb?

15:28.100 --> 15:28.590
Me.

15:29.020 --> 15:29.940
I'm good at it.

15:41.020 --> 15:41.700
I heard

15:41.720 --> 15:43.080
you often exchange gifts.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.960
Before I met Captain Lu, I've never met anyone

15:45.980 --> 15:47.060
who was better at making bombs than me.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.240
I finally met a rival.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.180
I can't waste my chance.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.500
We are simulating real cases

16:06.500 --> 16:07.750
that happened both domestically and internationally.

16:08.810 --> 16:09.740
They are not planned scenarios

16:09.740 --> 16:10.900
but actual cases bomb disposal experts

16:10.900 --> 16:11.470
have faced.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.470
This bomb is strong enough

16:16.010 --> 16:17.610
to make sure no one at the scene can survive.

16:20.970 --> 16:21.610
Command Center.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.740
The explosive has been triggered.

16:24.910 --> 16:25.480
It can't be moved anymore.

16:26.010 --> 16:26.840
Given the conditions here,

16:27.130 --> 16:28.710
we won't be able to dispose it with machinery.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.240
I will be disposing it manually.

16:31.210 --> 16:31.760
Be careful.

16:32.460 --> 16:33.970
Everyone, evacuate from the center.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.990
Before coming to the team,

16:58.090 --> 16:59.270
I thought it was all about cutting wires.

16:59.590 --> 17:00.910
Just guess which one to cut.

17:02.450 --> 17:03.600
It's not that easy.

17:05.020 --> 17:05.839
The bomb you're met with

17:06.260 --> 17:07.800
every time will be different.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.329
The conditions of the scene will be different too.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.750
The only similarity is

17:10.970 --> 17:12.280
you have no chance to fail.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.160
Your first failure

17:16.089 --> 17:17.150
will also be your last.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.440
The explosion device has been disposed successfully.

18:07.580 --> 18:08.090
Zhou Xin.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.140
Now it's your turn

18:10.140 --> 18:10.980
to operate the robot

18:11.340 --> 18:12.080
to move the bomb.

18:12.180 --> 18:12.620
Roger.

19:09.860 --> 19:10.850
The bomb has been disposed.

19:13.760 --> 19:14.620
It's as if it were real.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.740
I'm so nervous that I'm sweating.

19:18.820 --> 19:19.640
It is real.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.060
This is a bomb

19:21.060 --> 19:21.860
Captain Lu has once disposed.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.180
It is a real life simulation.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.630
The only difference is, the bomb today

19:27.380 --> 19:28.810
was made by me.

19:29.550 --> 19:30.700
It's more complex

19:31.290 --> 19:31.960
and dangerous.

20:00.660 --> 20:01.380
Sorry.

20:01.460 --> 20:02.170
I'm late.

20:06.460 --> 20:07.500
Guess what I did yesterday.

20:08.210 --> 20:08.640
Drinking.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.240
How did you know?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.070
The finance team came to me just now,

20:12.090 --> 20:12.900
asking me why

20:12.900 --> 20:14.140
your recent reimbursements

20:14.170 --> 20:14.890
are all drinking expenses.

20:16.090 --> 20:16.780
I told him

20:16.810 --> 20:17.660
you're going to get

20:17.660 --> 20:18.570
a blind box project.

20:21.710 --> 20:23.030
If this continues,

20:23.310 --> 20:24.650
I'm going to open a blind box store myself.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.630
I didn't expect

20:26.940 --> 20:27.940
blind boxes to become so trendy

20:27.940 --> 20:28.830
over the past two years.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.410
You can't even invest in it even if you have money.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.330
Work hard in the next round.

20:33.460 --> 20:33.920
I have another

20:33.950 --> 20:35.280
due diligence I have to do for a education platform.

20:36.140 --> 20:37.510
Education is easy.

20:37.530 --> 20:38.490
It's the easiest to get contacts in.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.190
You seem to be very interested

20:43.220 --> 20:44.300
in things about kids.

20:45.980 --> 20:46.880
I like kids.

20:50.330 --> 20:50.780
You're back.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.200
How's your due diligence?

20:52.530 --> 20:53.560
I just finished talking with my client.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.680
It went well.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.300
I was afraid you wouldn't have time

20:56.320 --> 20:57.060
to have a meeting with us.

20:57.900 --> 20:58.700
I have time.

20:59.030 --> 20:59.830
As long as I'm awake,

20:59.850 --> 21:00.730
it's working time.

21:01.220 --> 21:01.620
Go ahead.

21:07.130 --> 21:07.930
It's a call from Qining.

21:15.730 --> 21:16.050
Hello?

21:17.180 --> 21:17.670
Lu,

21:17.970 --> 21:19.150
I saw the note you left.

21:19.260 --> 21:19.830
I just came back.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.180
I'm telling you,

21:21.580 --> 21:23.170
there has been to many missions lately.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.360
My household register is still at home.

21:24.390 --> 21:25.500
I don't have time to pick it up.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.620
The school year is about to start.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.150
Yes, I know.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.140
I’ll discuss it with his mother.

21:38.740 --> 21:39.670
It’s Lu Yanchen's call?

21:40.940 --> 21:41.500
Tell him

21:41.970 --> 21:43.380
his transfer procedure isn't completed yet.

21:43.410 --> 21:44.420
Ask him to come over when he's free.

21:44.850 --> 21:45.930
Okay, I'll tell him now.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.700
Did you hear that?

21:52.530 --> 21:53.250
Come back soon.

21:53.900 --> 21:54.900
When you come back this time,

21:54.920 --> 21:55.890
you might meet

21:55.890 --> 21:56.820
the person you've been wanting to see.

21:57.060 --> 21:57.800
There's a clue?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.710
Fortunately, your transfer procedure is not complete yet.

22:03.180 --> 22:04.590
So you're still considered to be under Qining.

22:05.030 --> 22:06.630
It used to be a case you handled.

22:07.140 --> 22:07.970
You have to complete the handover.

22:08.980 --> 22:09.460
Come back.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.000
It's almost at the end.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.650
I'll arrange it as soon as possible.

22:15.780 --> 22:16.100
Okay.

22:21.020 --> 22:21.460
Captain.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.620
I'm informing you,

22:23.660 --> 22:24.790
Captain Lu is on leave

22:25.130 --> 22:25.980
to make a trip back to Qining.

22:26.620 --> 22:28.220
You'd have to take on more responsibilities for the work here.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.580
I heard about it.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.350
I saw his ex-colleague that day.

22:31.660 --> 22:32.860
He said he never took a day off

22:32.890 --> 22:34.080
since he joined the police force.

22:34.580 --> 22:35.500
I guess something urgent came up

22:35.520 --> 22:36.840
for him to return to Qining this time.

22:38.900 --> 22:39.760
They've found some clues

22:40.620 --> 22:41.530
for an old case.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.260
Thank you for your hard work.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.770
Boss, you saying this

22:51.770 --> 22:53.390
make me feel like I have to work overtime today.

22:53.780 --> 22:54.970
That's up to you.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.180
Mr. Sun.

23:07.730 --> 23:08.700
I'm free.

23:09.990 --> 23:11.160
Okay, thank you.

23:11.980 --> 23:12.500
Bye.

23:15.020 --> 23:15.900
I won't have dinner

23:15.900 --> 23:16.770
with you all later.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.540
You're going home, right?

23:18.820 --> 23:19.460
Take me with you.

23:19.460 --> 23:20.310
I didn't drive today.

23:20.680 --> 23:21.440
We're going in the same direction.

23:22.020 --> 23:22.360
Okay.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
Bye. Bye.

23:40.090 --> 23:40.400
Here.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.210
Eat more.

23:47.940 --> 23:48.660
How long were you

23:48.660 --> 23:49.180
standing alone

23:49.180 --> 23:49.940
by the school gate today?

23:50.940 --> 23:52.630
Not long. I thought about it.

23:53.060 --> 23:53.860
If no one comes by the time night falls,

23:54.130 --> 23:54.980
I'll sleep in the classroom.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.820
What are you talking about?

23:56.820 --> 23:57.980
You should've called me.

23:58.210 --> 23:58.960
Why didn't you call me?

24:00.200 --> 24:00.870
It's fine.

24:02.380 --> 24:03.150
Sorry, Nan.

24:03.660 --> 24:04.440
I'm really sorry.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.280
There was an accident on the road

24:06.310 --> 24:07.000
so I was stuck in traffic.

24:10.340 --> 24:11.560
Your house is far away.

24:11.810 --> 24:12.500
What time

24:12.500 --> 24:14.000
do you normally send him to school?

24:14.820 --> 24:16.180
If I send him,

24:16.180 --> 24:17.250
it's at 5 a.m.

24:17.970 --> 24:19.320
Otherwise, there must be traffic jam.

24:19.670 --> 24:20.200
He'll be late.

24:21.180 --> 24:21.860
But it was

24:21.860 --> 24:22.850
Lu Chen who asked me for this favor.

24:22.900 --> 24:23.940
I have to help my brother.

24:23.960 --> 24:24.560
It doesn't matter.

24:24.940 --> 24:25.950
For him,

24:26.070 --> 24:27.050
I don't even drink alcohol anymore.

24:27.740 --> 24:28.610
I have to be his driver.

24:30.620 --> 24:31.060
Oh right,

24:32.060 --> 24:32.790
look at this screenshot.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.460
Lu Chen sent it to me.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.180
This is the homework left by the teacher.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.270
They get homework assigned online now?

24:38.360 --> 24:38.750
Yes.

24:39.390 --> 24:39.830
Nowadays,

24:39.860 --> 24:41.180
you can see what homework

24:41.180 --> 24:41.940
the teacher has assigned

24:41.940 --> 24:42.860
when you click into an app you download.

24:42.860 --> 24:43.320
Look.

24:44.420 --> 24:45.540
Today's Chinese homework

24:45.540 --> 24:46.580
is reciting.

24:46.580 --> 24:47.860
Math homework is calculation.

24:47.910 --> 24:48.750
These are simple.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.240
But I'm really not good at English.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.480
How about this?

24:56.640 --> 24:58.110
Leave Qin Xiaonan to me this week.

24:58.180 --> 24:58.800
He can stay at my place.

24:59.430 --> 25:00.310
I'm not going on a business trip either.

25:00.340 --> 25:01.660
I'll be home from Monday to Friday.

25:01.980 --> 25:03.050
I can even help him with his homework.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.430
Is that appropriate?

25:06.700 --> 25:07.990
Why not?

25:09.060 --> 25:09.740
He stayed at my place

25:09.740 --> 25:10.670
when he first came to Beijing.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.810
Thank you so much then.

25:14.850 --> 25:15.930
Thank you, family.

25:16.740 --> 25:18.490
Eat up. It's on you.

25:19.110 --> 25:19.420
Sure.

25:34.270 --> 25:35.110
Ask me if you have any questions.

25:35.690 --> 25:36.420
At your age,

25:36.420 --> 25:37.380
you should keep asking questions.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.800
Aunt Gui Xiao, what are you reading?

25:42.580 --> 25:44.090
I'm reading a financial report.

25:44.860 --> 25:46.180
I have to monitor the operations

25:46.180 --> 25:47.570
of projects I invested in every month

25:47.780 --> 25:48.560
through this.

25:50.780 --> 25:51.580
What about Aunt Duan Rou?

25:54.690 --> 25:56.700
I'm watching "The Good Dinosaur."

25:57.480 --> 25:58.390
Be serious.

26:02.690 --> 26:05.080
I'm looking at a nursing home's introduction.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.100
My friend's mother

26:07.190 --> 26:08.500
wants to move to a nursing home lately.

26:09.250 --> 26:10.620
I found that this is

26:10.620 --> 26:12.040
a very promising project.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.340
So I'm going to invest.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.650
Have we fed your curiosity yet?

26:20.580 --> 26:21.620
I'll continue with

26:21.620 --> 26:22.640
my Chinese homework.

26:28.660 --> 26:29.660
Take whatever you want.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.740
If you talk about such professional things with a kid,

26:39.020 --> 26:39.940
he won't be able to understand.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.060
This is how my mum

26:42.060 --> 26:43.220
talked to me since I was a kid.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.360
She never gloss over her words.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.080
She answers

26:45.110 --> 26:46.100
whatever I ask.

26:46.820 --> 26:47.870
I think it's good.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.820
It made me feel like this world is amazing

26:49.820 --> 26:51.410
since I was young,

26:52.030 --> 26:53.070
and I have to study hard

26:53.330 --> 26:54.540
so that I can have a good job.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.060
Your mother taught you so well.

26:58.740 --> 26:59.480
Sleep with me tonight.

26:59.750 --> 27:00.790
I'll sleep with Xiaonan.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.540
Qin Xiaonan told me secretly that

27:04.860 --> 27:05.990
every time he stays at your place,

27:06.130 --> 27:07.170
he doesn't dare to go to the toilet at midnight.

27:07.820 --> 27:08.760
Your house is too big.

27:09.380 --> 27:10.110
I promised to sleep with him.

27:10.250 --> 27:10.950
I'll turn the light on for him at night,

27:12.430 --> 27:13.790
He never told me about that.

27:14.660 --> 27:15.540
You are the host,

27:15.680 --> 27:17.190
he's a child. He's too shy to say it.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.290
This kid.

27:19.850 --> 27:21.210
But he's not shy to talk about it with another guest?

27:21.870 --> 27:22.310
Yes.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.100
Fine, it's a double bed anyway.

27:28.660 --> 27:31.360
How are you and your ex-boyfriend?

27:32.820 --> 27:33.930
We're getting along.

27:34.460 --> 27:34.990
We're friends.

27:37.140 --> 27:38.020
Is he single?

27:39.340 --> 27:40.670
Kind of.

27:42.330 --> 27:43.120
What about in the past?

27:44.880 --> 27:45.750
It was a little complicated.

28:04.930 --> 28:05.330
Son.

28:06.170 --> 28:06.860
Are you up?

28:07.600 --> 28:08.570
Did you do your homework last night?

28:09.260 --> 28:10.210
How is the new campus?

28:10.240 --> 28:10.940
Do you have enough money?

28:12.200 --> 28:16.380
[Dad]

28:16.450 --> 28:17.330
I'm sorry.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.740
Your son went out.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.480
I answered his call in a daze.

28:26.050 --> 28:27.160
You are...

28:27.420 --> 28:29.200
I'm a colleague of Gui Xiao.

28:29.330 --> 28:30.210
I'm helping her take care of your kid.

28:31.740 --> 28:33.010
I'm so grate...

28:33.910 --> 28:34.750
Don't stand on ceremony.

28:35.330 --> 28:36.280
I like him.

28:37.610 --> 28:38.100
Thank you.

28:38.930 --> 28:39.440
You're welcome.

28:41.170 --> 28:41.780
Nan.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.540
I'll ask him to call you back later.

28:48.100 --> 28:48.440
Okay.

28:50.380 --> 28:50.730
Bye.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.340
Have some hot food.

28:56.050 --> 28:56.980
It's too late for lamb soup.

28:56.980 --> 28:57.660
The meeting is starting.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.370
How's your son dealing with his school transfer?

29:02.770 --> 29:03.560
I don't know.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.680
You called him for so long, you didn't ask?

29:06.580 --> 29:08.150
My son didn't answer the call.

29:08.660 --> 29:09.180
It's Captain Lu's

29:09.200 --> 29:10.360
ex-girlfriend's colleague who picked it up.

29:18.910 --> 29:20.380
Hello. It's Lu Yanchen.

29:22.920 --> 29:23.480
Lu.

29:24.140 --> 29:24.500
My son

29:24.500 --> 29:25.710
is still at your ex's house?

29:26.140 --> 29:26.930
I don't think it's appropriate.

29:29.620 --> 29:30.460
My friend's taking care of him.

29:31.810 --> 29:32.570
Impossible.

29:32.870 --> 29:33.890
I just called him.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.280
Gui Xiao's colleague picked it up.

29:35.940 --> 29:36.990
You haven't been home these days?

29:38.300 --> 29:38.660
Yes.

29:39.460 --> 29:40.480
Turn on your phone.

29:40.650 --> 29:42.040
Buy Gui Xiao a meal for me.

29:42.370 --> 29:43.260
I feel bad.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.720
[Yonghe Palace Street]

30:04.770 --> 30:05.340
Get in the car and wait.

30:12.140 --> 30:12.660
Are you off work?

30:13.290 --> 30:13.940
Not yet.

30:15.140 --> 30:15.730
I'm off work.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.710
I'll show Nan around

30:23.390 --> 30:24.170
and wait for you nearby.

30:25.470 --> 30:26.620
But I still have a while to go.

30:28.470 --> 30:29.160
I'm off work.

30:30.020 --> 30:30.580
I'll wait no matter how late it is.

30:31.820 --> 30:32.540
You can't do that.

30:33.150 --> 30:34.180
He has homework to do.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.460
I'll find a place to get a glass of water

30:36.990 --> 30:37.720
and take him to do homework.

30:38.510 --> 30:39.430
No.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.340
He can't focus on his homework this way.

30:41.790 --> 30:42.740
It's not good for him.

30:47.930 --> 30:48.770
I didn't realize

30:49.970 --> 30:51.340
that you're quite experienced in taking care of children.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.570
I didn't realize

30:53.600 --> 30:54.900
you could take care of a child alone.

31:02.670 --> 31:03.120
I'll wait for you.

31:07.660 --> 31:08.950
Nan knows my place better than you do.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.060
Go ahead.

31:11.380 --> 31:11.990
By myself?

31:13.990 --> 31:15.440
It's for Xiaonan to do his homework.

31:16.220 --> 31:17.420
It's on the sake of Xiaonan.

32:03.020 --> 32:03.380
Change into these.

32:11.910 --> 32:13.580
What do you want to drink? I'll get it for you.

32:14.180 --> 32:14.560
Get lost.

32:15.460 --> 32:16.160
Is this your home?

32:16.650 --> 32:17.450
Being all hospitable.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.410
I'm going to go do my homework if you don't want anything to drink.

32:21.830 --> 32:22.180
Go.

32:43.910 --> 32:44.460
Don't touch

32:44.460 --> 32:45.440
Aunt Gui Xiao's things.

32:45.930 --> 32:46.620
She doesn't like it.

32:47.350 --> 32:48.040
Go do your homework.

33:43.380 --> 33:46.380
♫You must have secretly collected♫

33:46.410 --> 33:48.810
♫So much wind and frost♫

33:50.460 --> 33:53.680
♫Waiting to meet someone♫

33:53.780 --> 33:56.030

34:05.500 --> 34:07.910
♫Half a moon♫

34:09.170 --> 34:10.960
♫The moon♫

34:13.389 --> 34:16.270
♫You must have wiped it silently♫

34:16.300 --> 34:18.580
♫For a long time♫

34:20.320 --> 34:23.040
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

34:23.070 --> 34:25.920

34:28.300 --> 34:33.250
♫On a night when no one knows♫

34:34.320 --> 34:35.620
I bought you takeout.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.889
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

34:37.639 --> 34:38.219
What a waste.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.050
♫The breeze♫

34:41.179 --> 34:41.679
No.

34:42.989 --> 34:43.969
We'll take it back and eat it at home.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.639
♫You must have been there in secret♫

♫Bringing back the green plants of summer♫

34:53.739 --> 34:57.660
♫And the fallen leaves of autumn♫

34:53.889 --> 34:54.710
Let me help you.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.550

♫On a night when you're dating in the garden♫

35:05.240 --> 35:10.990
♫The pathos of youth is sung♫

35:10.260 --> 35:11.640
This is his homework this week.

35:11.660 --> 35:12.630
I've sorted them according

35:12.660 --> 35:13.310
to their subjects.

35:13.550 --> 35:14.800
The post-its on it

35:14.980 --> 35:16.400
also says what he has to do.

35:20.110 --> 35:21.250
I'm a master of self-care？

35:22.980 --> 35:23.780
He needs to

35:23.780 --> 35:24.700
pack his own bag,

35:24.700 --> 35:26.270
bed, and wardrobe.

35:26.740 --> 35:27.220
When he's done packing them,

35:27.220 --> 35:28.350
give him a star

35:28.570 --> 35:29.520
and have him hand it in to the teacher.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.480
The education system nowadays

35:33.970 --> 35:35.320
is indeed different from what we had.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.780
Yes, it's very meticulous.

35:46.020 --> 35:46.390
Bye.

35:56.210 --> 35:57.550
I'm on break this week.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.030
If you're free,

36:00.620 --> 36:01.240
feel free to look for me.

36:05.060 --> 36:05.390
Let's go.

36:06.700 --> 36:07.540
Goodbye, Aunt Gui Xiao.

36:26.890 --> 36:28.830
Do you want to go back with us?

36:30.820 --> 36:31.620
Now?

36:32.530 --> 36:33.470
I can drive back.

36:35.060 --> 36:35.700
What I mean is,

36:37.050 --> 36:37.710
I can take you there,

36:38.770 --> 36:39.420
and you can live

36:39.420 --> 36:40.220
at Meng Xiaoshan's house

36:40.720 --> 36:41.340
and have a catch up with her.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.200
Go pack your things.

36:49.660 --> 36:50.310
Give me ten minutes.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.300
I haven't been back for a long time.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.850
There's no one to clean this place.

37:16.110 --> 37:16.700
It's okay.

37:24.660 --> 37:25.360
You're back.

37:29.590 --> 37:30.280
I'll take you home first.

37:36.730 --> 37:39.040
Who is she? Is she your girlfriend?

37:40.390 --> 37:41.750
Why can't I see her?

37:41.850 --> 37:42.650
Why are you running?

37:46.340 --> 37:47.070
That's my dad.

37:48.460 --> 37:48.960
I know.

37:51.190 --> 37:51.800
Have you seen him?

37:53.130 --> 37:53.590
In the past?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.210
I remember his voice.

38:01.340 --> 38:02.340
Brat,

38:02.340 --> 38:03.980
do you think this is a hotel?

38:04.380 --> 38:05.130
Come out!

38:06.220 --> 38:07.090
Get out!

38:08.070 --> 38:08.920
Get out!

38:09.700 --> 38:10.460
Come out!

38:13.450 --> 38:14.830
I didn't expect you to remember it for so many years.

38:18.740 --> 38:19.380
I wanted to

38:19.380 --> 38:20.380
spend a nice weekend with you.

38:21.230 --> 38:21.670
I'm sorry.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.570
We can spend it even without staying here.

38:29.950 --> 38:31.310
You're so boring.

38:32.290 --> 38:33.900
We dated in the garage when we were young.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.190
Do we still date here now?

38:39.020 --> 38:39.400
Let's go.

38:40.500 --> 38:40.970
Where are we going?

38:42.110 --> 38:43.080
We can't stay here anyway.

38:43.720 --> 38:43.990
Let's go.

38:57.940 --> 38:58.900
It's locked.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.800
[Manhei Billiard Club]

39:03.680 --> 39:06.310
This is... A master key?

39:07.260 --> 39:07.940
What are you thinking?

39:08.570 --> 39:09.280
It's just a normal key.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.490
What does a normal key even mean.

39:15.150 --> 39:16.140
Even if this is

39:16.140 --> 39:17.660
Meng Xiaoshan's husband's place,

39:17.780 --> 39:19.300
we can't just go in, right?

39:19.610 --> 39:20.560
Qin Feng gave me the key.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.700
He wants me to check the

39:27.900 --> 39:29.020
surveillance equipment here

39:29.020 --> 39:30.060
since I'm on break.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.210
That's why I have this.

39:32.410 --> 39:33.230
You should have told me earlier.

39:57.580 --> 39:59.200
Do you remember where you sat?

40:02.780 --> 40:03.310
By the window.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.400
You turned in and saw Hai Jianfeng,

40:09.830 --> 40:10.980
and got off the car to talk to him

40:21.100 --> 40:22.630
I knew you could see me coming.

40:31.930 --> 40:32.610
It's quite comfortable.

40:41.710 --> 40:42.620
Why did you pretend

40:42.650 --> 40:43.700
not to know me that day?

40:45.260 --> 40:46.070
It was crowded that day.

40:46.840 --> 40:47.790
I was afraid that people would make a fuss.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.440
How many times

40:55.260 --> 40:56.540
have we broken up?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.030
Not even once.

41:04.740 --> 41:05.700
Impossible.

41:06.210 --> 41:07.860
There are so many times I remember.

41:09.180 --> 41:10.480
It takes two to break up.

41:11.270 --> 41:12.260
Except for the last time,

41:12.810 --> 41:13.540
it was always you

41:13.540 --> 41:14.360
who announced that

41:14.380 --> 41:15.070
you've dumped me.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.050
So it's not called breaking up.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.400
Fine, fight.

41:22.300 --> 41:23.340
A one-sided fight?

41:25.540 --> 41:27.410
I remember now. The first time was

41:28.420 --> 41:29.850
the day we took graduation photos.

41:29.870 --> 41:31.540
Your classmate made a fuss,

41:31.860 --> 41:33.520
saying your deskmate has a crush on you.

41:35.460 --> 41:36.070
I guess.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.880
Why do I still get jealous thinking about it now?

41:42.400 --> 41:42.840
That's normal.

41:45.740 --> 41:47.590
What do you mean?

42:02.050 --> 42:02.650
What are you doing?

42:05.080 --> 42:05.610
You came

42:05.630 --> 42:06.650
all the way here to date?

42:06.930 --> 42:07.630
You even broke in.

42:09.390 --> 42:10.570
Your boss gave me the key.

42:12.980 --> 42:13.840
That's really his key.

42:14.000 --> 42:14.620
Who are you?

42:15.770 --> 42:16.250
Lu Chen.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.170
Are you that bomb disposal expert from Lu family?

42:20.500 --> 42:20.870
A SWAT.

42:21.230 --> 42:22.000
I know. I know.

42:22.090 --> 42:22.830
You're a bomb disposal expert.

42:23.570 --> 42:25.380
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

42:26.890 --> 42:27.480
Something happened?

42:29.190 --> 42:29.700
Your boss

42:29.700 --> 42:30.860
asked me to check

42:30.960 --> 42:31.980
the surveillance system here.

42:32.580 --> 42:33.620
He said there were blind spots.

42:34.350 --> 42:35.300
He asked me to adjust

42:35.330 --> 42:36.210
the angle of the camera.

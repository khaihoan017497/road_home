It's snowing. Drive slowly.

01:54.650 --> 01:55.190
Okay.

02:11.910 --> 02:12.430
What are you looking for?

02:16.700 --> 02:17.220
This.

02:52.260 --> 02:52.780
Captain Lu.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.070
Thank you so much. See you next time.

03:04.130 --> 03:04.570
Thank you.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.350
No worries.

03:14.050 --> 03:14.530
Bye.

03:18.980 --> 03:19.460
Bye.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.060
Don't you want to get up?

03:48.380 --> 03:49.780
I pretended so hard.

03:50.310 --> 03:51.870
Can't you

03:51.900 --> 03:53.060
talk to her more?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.079
How pointless it would be

03:55.620 --> 03:56.260
if I fumbled for something to say.

03:57.260 --> 03:59.530
In my view, you have a lot to say.

03:59.810 --> 04:00.410
In your view?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.230
How old are you?

04:02.780 --> 04:03.780
What can you tell?

04:04.350 --> 04:05.660
Aunt Gui Xiao.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.850
You like her, don't you?

Silence

means a yes.

04:12.180 --> 04:13.770
When we were eating just now,

04:13.880 --> 04:15.220
I asked them about their schedule.

04:15.620 --> 04:17.620
They will depart from town in two days

04:17.850 --> 04:18.529
to the city.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.220
And they're not traveling for work.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.060
They came for sightseeing.

04:27.910 --> 04:28.840
Are you playing dumb?

04:29.660 --> 04:31.000
This is not your personality.

04:31.980 --> 04:32.580
Captain Lu.

04:33.820 --> 04:34.520
I'm not playing dumb.

04:35.180 --> 04:36.140
I'm just lazy to answer.

04:36.780 --> 04:37.460
Do you think

04:37.740 --> 04:38.810
I didn't hear your question?

04:42.590 --> 04:43.390
Did you eavesdrop on our conversation?

04:43.870 --> 04:44.330
Sit back.

04:45.540 --> 04:46.980
You can't talk to the driver in a car.

06:19.180 --> 06:20.630
Were you in a relationship with Captain Lu before?

06:21.620 --> 06:22.240
To be honest,

06:22.900 --> 06:23.740
when I saw you two

06:23.740 --> 06:25.010
sitting side by side in the car,

06:25.220 --> 06:27.090
I felt something was off.

06:28.780 --> 06:29.260
Nope.

06:30.180 --> 06:30.780
We are alumni.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.000
It seemed awkward

06:33.100 --> 06:34.310
because we shared no topic.

06:42.620 --> 06:44.810
Your former classmate is too courteous.

06:45.620 --> 06:46.750
I wanted to buy him some supplements,

06:46.750 --> 06:47.390
but he refused.

Lu Yanchen?

06:50.550 --> 06:51.150
Yes.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.659
He helped us twice.

06:53.700 --> 06:54.220
Last night,

06:54.240 --> 06:55.350
he even saved our lives.

06:56.340 --> 06:57.100
So I suggested buying some supplements

06:57.100 --> 06:58.380
for him.

06:58.380 --> 06:59.260
I also offered to buy food and supplies

06:59.260 --> 07:00.300
for the little boy.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.100
But he refused everything.

07:03.540 --> 07:03.980
No way.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.220
to repay Captain Lu's kindness.

15:10.220 --> 15:11.270
I have to complete the task.

15:11.570 --> 15:12.730
I can give him the gift in passing.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.680
He asked me to go?

15:16.270 --> 15:16.960
Impossible.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.270
Look.

15:22.820 --> 15:24.110
Captain Lu wants to meet Miss Gui Xiao.

15:24.380 --> 15:25.910
Please invite her over.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.060
I'll treat her to a meal.

15:30.790 --> 15:31.670
I'm not going, really.

15:33.740 --> 15:34.180
Hello.

15:37.780 --> 15:38.690
Aunt Gui Xiao.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.050
My dad and Uncle Lu are drunk.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.000
Please come over quickly.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.240
Everyone has left.

15:43.620 --> 15:44.890
I can't handle them myself.

15:48.330 --> 15:49.080
There are so many people.

15:49.470 --> 15:49.910
They can't really

15:49.910 --> 15:50.940
leave them alone.

15:53.230 --> 15:54.780
When I was your age,

15:55.090 --> 15:56.500
I stopped telling such lies.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.140
Is she coming?

16:03.810 --> 16:05.090
Try what I just taught you.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.420
Aunt Gui Xiao.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.460
Are you Uncle Lu's first love?

16:13.110 --> 16:14.310
Uncle Lu is drunk.

16:14.590 --> 16:15.690
Poor him.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.560
His eyes are red.

16:18.380 --> 16:19.300
And he is talking about your past

16:19.620 --> 16:21.060
with my dad.

16:27.660 --> 16:28.060
You...

16:31.100 --> 16:31.780
Keep an eye on them.

16:32.620 --> 16:33.950
It's late, so I won't go over there.

16:34.230 --> 16:35.470
It's not dark yet.

16:35.470 --> 16:36.050
Gui Xiao.

16:52.210 --> 16:53.160
Ask him for an address.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.860
You're such a little smart cookie.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.010
How did you persuade him?

17:05.119 --> 17:06.060
It's just teamwork.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.369
Aunt Cai,

17:08.060 --> 17:09.780
I'll leave the rest to you.

17:09.869 --> 17:10.579
Leave it to me?

17:10.859 --> 17:12.380
I'd love to

17:12.380 --> 17:13.140
do matchmaking for my savior.

17:13.630 --> 17:14.960
Send me the address. Hurry.

17:17.780 --> 17:19.020
Boss, hurry up.

17:19.020 --> 17:19.310
Okay.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.210
Here, scan here will do.

17:23.770 --> 17:24.339
It's paid.

17:24.359 --> 17:24.980
Okay.

17:35.030 --> 17:37.680
♫How much I want to go back home♫

17:37.900 --> 17:40.580
♫To be by her side again♫

17:40.940 --> 17:43.550
♫To see her kindness and gentleness♫

17:43.900 --> 17:46.510
♫To soothe my broken heart♫

17:47.150 --> 17:49.740
♫Let me go back home♫

17:51.180 --> 17:51.550
Hello.

17:51.550 --> 17:51.970
Hello.

17:53.100 --> 17:53.700
We're looking for Captain Lu.

17:55.550 --> 17:56.350
Come in.

17:56.350 --> 18:00.260
♫To soothe my broken heart♫

17:58.270 --> 17:59.340
Come in, please.

18:01.140 --> 18:06.120
♫The year you set off into the twilight♫

18:06.670 --> 18:10.290
♫You thought there was something there♫

18:09.260 --> 18:10.060
Stop singing.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.310
Captain Lu is inside.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.610
Just go inside.

18:14.100 --> 18:14.940
I'm here

18:15.830 --> 18:16.950
just to see him.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.390
Give them some space.

18:25.750 --> 18:26.270
Yes.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.790
♫Can you hear me?♫

18:30.160 --> 18:32.910
♫All these years♫

18:33.560 --> 18:39.600
♫The anticipation from the depths of my soul♫

18:40.510 --> 18:42.610
♫An ethereal heart♫

18:43.790 --> 18:46.030
♫A healed wound♫

18:47.290 --> 18:53.570
♫The eagerness to wait for you has overtaken the anxiety♫

18:54.170 --> 18:56.760
♫Turning around and brushing past♫

18:57.540 --> 19:00.480
♫I'm the only one left in the world♫

19:01.050 --> 19:03.720
♫Waiting for fate to take its course♫

19:04.460 --> 19:07.540
♫Listen to the sound of approaching footsteps♫

19:07.920 --> 19:10.390
♫In a flash, I'm not paying attention♫

19:10.580 --> 19:11.100
Lu Chen.

19:11.380 --> 19:14.210
♫The whole heart has fallen and lost its soul♫

19:14.810 --> 19:17.510
♫I accept the push of destiny♫

♫Can you hear me?♫

♫All these years♫

♫The anticipation from the depths of my soul♫

♫An ethereal heart♫

19:36.390 --> 19:38.110
I wouldn't have come if you hadn't called me.

19:38.740 --> 19:41.330
♫A healed wound♫

19:40.600 --> 19:41.270
I called you?

19:42.170 --> 19:48.580
♫The eagerness to wait for you has overtaken the anxiety♫

19:47.950 --> 19:48.380
Gao Hai.

19:52.230 --> 19:53.100
What's wrong, Captain Lu?

19:53.560 --> 19:53.890
Come.

19:54.770 --> 19:55.330
Come closer to me.

19:56.660 --> 19:57.130
Captain Lu.

19:58.180 --> 19:58.670
Apologize.

20:05.300 --> 20:05.740
Well...

20:07.020 --> 20:08.340
I'm sorry, Miss Gui Xiao.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.060
Just now,

20:10.950 --> 20:12.280
I pretended to be Captain Lu.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.830
I always like to

20:14.860 --> 20:15.970
imitate people's voices.

20:16.860 --> 20:18.060
I'm just kidding.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.060
For the sake of mission,

20:21.830 --> 20:22.560
he has been

20:22.800 --> 20:24.040
learning voice imitation for years.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.160
It does sound similar.

20:26.540 --> 20:28.480
How could you make such a joke?

20:29.380 --> 20:30.540
Gui Xiao, I'm sorry.

20:31.060 --> 20:31.670
It's okay.

20:32.890 --> 20:33.440
You imitate it

20:34.420 --> 20:35.060
quite well.

20:36.910 --> 20:37.600
Miss Gui Xiao.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.040
On behalf of my second hometown,

20:40.240 --> 20:40.810
Qining,

20:41.180 --> 20:42.950
on behalf of our brigade, I welcome you.

20:43.580 --> 20:44.950
You will definitely fall in love with Qining.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.230
Just like you do with your hometown.

20:48.060 --> 20:49.300
This is Captain Lu's favorite place.

20:53.200 --> 20:53.510
By the way,

20:54.080 --> 20:55.560
the mutton here is delicious.

20:55.940 --> 20:57.150
Captain Lu is unoccupied now.

20:57.780 --> 20:59.510
Captain Lu, remember to

20:59.790 --> 21:00.850
take them there to eat.

21:07.390 --> 21:08.700
You guys continue.

21:08.730 --> 21:09.430
I'll leave you alone.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.800
They are used to fooling around,

21:18.940 --> 21:19.680
without having a sense of propriety.

21:26.980 --> 21:27.330
Sit.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.670
Shouldn't you apologize first?

21:32.300 --> 21:32.800
Captain Lu.

21:34.870 --> 21:35.250
Please excuse me.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.550
I was rude just now.

21:43.140 --> 21:44.420
I just heard on the phone that

21:45.660 --> 21:47.190
no one could handle you when you were drunk,

21:48.380 --> 21:49.140
and you were talking nonsense

21:49.140 --> 21:50.280
about our past.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.500
Then I heard you call my name.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.110
So I came because I was afraid something would happen.

21:56.730 --> 21:57.580
Since it's a misunderstanding,

21:58.670 --> 21:59.550
I'm leaving now.

22:00.060 --> 22:00.610
Have a seat.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.390
I'll send you back later.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.040
I've been here for days.

22:08.740 --> 22:09.170
You don't have to see me off.

22:10.700 --> 22:11.300
Anyway,

22:13.290 --> 22:14.500
there will be no next time.

22:18.940 --> 22:20.500
Lu Chen, if you dare to hang up on me,

22:20.910 --> 22:21.900
there will be no next time.

22:22.860 --> 22:24.340
You'll never see me again.

22:40.870 --> 22:41.650
So soon?

22:41.980 --> 22:43.620
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet since I entered the house.

22:45.220 --> 22:45.780
My head hurts.

22:46.580 --> 22:47.310
I don't feel well.

22:50.820 --> 22:51.590
Let me see you off.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.780
I've known her for years.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.000
She is really angry now.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.010
Don't worry.

22:56.140 --> 22:56.970
I'll talk to her later.

22:57.360 --> 22:57.820
Thank you.

23:01.210 --> 23:01.790
Do you want to drive?

23:14.750 --> 23:16.220
See you, Captain Qin.

23:17.430 --> 23:17.900
Bye.

23:19.060 --> 23:19.750
Let's go.

23:20.940 --> 23:22.490
I'm not defending Captain Lu.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.840
You may not know something.

23:25.390 --> 23:26.580
Qin Mingyu told me

23:27.020 --> 23:27.860
their former captain had perished in the line of duty

23:27.860 --> 23:29.300
last week.

23:33.100 --> 23:33.950
He said the captain had guided

23:33.980 --> 23:35.300
and supported Captain Lu all the way.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.670
But, he died right in front of Captain Lu.

23:40.900 --> 23:43.540
Captain Lu resigned because he blamed himself.

23:49.180 --> 23:51.240
Lu, try to comfort her.

23:55.620 --> 23:56.380
Uncle Lu.

24:04.580 --> 24:05.470
Aren't you cold?

24:19.220 --> 24:20.810
Anything else, Captain Lu?

24:23.060 --> 24:23.660
Do me a favor.

24:28.140 --> 24:28.670
Cai.

24:30.060 --> 24:30.630
Captain Lu.

24:32.040 --> 24:32.830
Please go ahead.

24:33.710 --> 24:34.460
I really need your help.

24:35.210 --> 24:36.340
I want that kid

24:36.340 --> 24:37.300
to study in Beijing.

24:38.100 --> 24:38.690
Can you

24:39.180 --> 24:40.540
find me a prestigious school?

24:41.030 --> 24:41.870
You want to go to Beijing

24:42.390 --> 24:43.310
with that kid?

24:52.980 --> 24:53.440
Gui Xiao.

24:56.340 --> 24:57.240
If it's simply a transfer to another school,

24:57.780 --> 24:59.060
you don't need to ask for help.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.070
You've been in Beijing longer than me.

25:02.830 --> 25:03.440
You're more familiar than me.

25:06.810 --> 25:07.570
Do me a favor.

25:09.620 --> 25:10.300
Gui Xiao.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.150
Think of it as helping me.

25:12.790 --> 25:13.930
This is on my account.

25:19.140 --> 25:20.350
I'm not a kid anymore

25:20.590 --> 25:21.410
to lose my temper.

25:26.700 --> 25:27.830
He apologized.

25:28.340 --> 25:29.650
There's no point in unforgiving.

25:32.460 --> 25:33.540
I'll go back to Beijing the day after tomorrow.

25:35.670 --> 25:36.260
But this is not

25:36.260 --> 25:37.500
as simple as you think.

25:37.690 --> 25:38.630
We need to work out the details.

25:39.740 --> 25:40.620
Take the kid to Beijing

25:40.620 --> 25:41.540
as soon as possible.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.750
It'd be better to get it done during the winter vacation.

25:44.060 --> 25:45.020
Don't delay his class.

25:45.260 --> 25:46.040
Let's discuss this now.

25:47.740 --> 25:48.360
Now?

25:51.460 --> 25:52.300
Do it now.

25:53.280 --> 25:53.780
You've helped me

25:53.780 --> 25:54.820
a lot.

25:54.820 --> 25:55.830
As his father,

25:55.830 --> 25:56.980
I should show my gratitude.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.100
Come in and have a bite.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.350
We won't let Captain Lu drink tonight.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.180
Let him drive you home.

26:01.020 --> 26:01.620
That's right.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.700
I haven't eaten anything yet.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.200
Captain Qin, is there any food inside?

26:06.300 --> 26:06.940
Anything you want.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.660
Help yourself. It's on my treat.

26:08.470 --> 26:09.070
No need.

26:09.980 --> 26:10.580
Gui Xiao.

26:32.980 --> 26:33.840
I really didn't know

26:34.180 --> 26:35.030
you were called here.

26:37.740 --> 26:38.270
Forget it.

26:39.040 --> 26:39.950
You know

26:39.970 --> 26:41.320
I buy the apologies.

26:43.050 --> 26:44.410
I'll be fine if you say sorry.

26:44.430 --> 26:44.920
I'm sorry.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.670
♫It was a hurry♫

27:14.860 --> 27:18.210
♫I saw you off with a song♫

27:18.630 --> 27:21.500
♫We were drunk in the wind♫

27:21.660 --> 27:22.090
Have a seat.

27:22.510 --> 27:25.100
♫And parted in different directions♫

27:26.100 --> 27:26.900
Alright, stop singing.

27:26.900 --> 27:27.870
Just listen to the song quietly.

27:27.070 --> 27:29.020
♫No need to say anything♫

27:31.180 --> 27:31.870
You guys talk first.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.340
♫No need to understand♫

27:33.490 --> 27:34.530
It's about your son.

27:34.550 --> 27:35.500
What should we talk about without you?

27:35.560 --> 27:38.380
♫A million miles across in a dream♫

27:37.830 --> 27:39.350
I'm going to look for food.

27:39.010 --> 27:41.580
♫A year simply passed by♫

27:42.700 --> 27:45.120
♫As long as you glanced back♫

27:46.540 --> 27:47.900
Tell me the details.

27:46.610 --> 27:49.000
♫That would be enough♫

27:49.200 --> 27:50.400
Let me make this clear.

27:51.140 --> 27:51.630
Gui Xiao.

27:51.390 --> 27:53.400
♫When the flowers fall♫

27:52.500 --> 27:54.100
Even if you fail,

27:54.270 --> 27:55.050
I'm still grateful to you.

27:54.510 --> 27:57.370
♫We'll meet again♫

27:56.580 --> 27:57.670
Don't mention it.

27:57.940 --> 27:58.660
Say something important.

27:58.580 --> 28:00.980
♫It was a hurry♫

28:01.270 --> 28:01.760
Here's the thing.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.200
I'm divorced

28:02.840 --> 28:04.980
♫I saw you off with a song♫

28:03.800 --> 28:04.730
and I took Xiaonan with me.

28:05.190 --> 28:05.710
I'm usually

28:05.810 --> 28:07.400
busy with the team

28:06.210 --> 28:08.690
♫We were drunk in the wind♫

28:07.780 --> 28:08.990
while Xiaonan is studying at a school on a temporary basis.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.130
No one takes care of him.

28:10.630 --> 28:11.430
Poor thing.

28:10.730 --> 28:13.110
♫And parted in different directions♫

28:13.740 --> 28:15.600
My household registration was in Beijing.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.540
♫The fog is thick♫

28:15.920 --> 28:16.990
I was transferred here because of work.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.250
When Xiaonan was born,

28:18.140 --> 28:20.550
♫I should never forget my original intention♫

28:20.660 --> 28:21.560
his household registration was under his mother.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.680
♫I used a bird to deliver the letter♫

28:22.750 --> 28:23.630
That's the situation.

28:24.990 --> 28:26.080
I can transfer back

28:25.810 --> 28:28.640
♫And hoped for a reply♫

28:26.110 --> 28:26.990
our household registration.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
But I want him

28:28.430 --> 28:29.520
to study in Beijing for a few years

28:29.220 --> 28:30.970
♫The years are rippling♫

28:30.280 --> 28:31.130
and live on campus

28:31.500 --> 28:32.280
when he's in junior high school.

28:31.580 --> 28:32.720
♫On both sides of the crowd♫

28:33.080 --> 28:36.230
♫Old wishes are hard to come true♫

28:35.020 --> 28:35.940
He's too young.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.500
I, as an outsider,

28:37.400 --> 28:38.570
♫Old dreams are vanquishable♫

28:37.500 --> 28:38.760
don't feel at ease listening,

28:38.990 --> 28:40.470
let alone you, his birth father.

28:39.410 --> 28:40.650
♫And there's nothing left but sighs♫

28:41.740 --> 28:44.970
♫The sound of memories never goes away♫

28:45.070 --> 28:46.590
I helped Yaya's relatives

28:45.600 --> 28:47.850
♫It should be the fallen leaves and frost♫

28:46.620 --> 28:47.460
with the same issue last year.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.490
♫I wish seeing the handwriting in your letter is like seeing you in person♫

28:49.180 --> 28:51.140
It's very similar.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.420
The transfer only requires a regular procedure.

28:52.850 --> 28:54.460
♫The past has not been left unattended♫

28:53.440 --> 28:54.320
It doesn't matter who handles it.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.590
But it can be a hassle

28:54.940 --> 28:55.980
♫With ink as a sail♫

28:56.620 --> 28:58.700
to transfer his household registration

28:56.890 --> 28:58.500
♫Tossing and turning between my fingers♫

28:58.700 --> 28:59.910
and go through the process.

28:59.910 --> 29:00.780
It may take a long time.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.610
♫The distance between us is far away♫

29:01.420 --> 29:02.100
So I suggest you

29:02.100 --> 29:03.860
find a private school

29:02.330 --> 29:04.120
♫Even if we don't meet each other♫

29:03.930 --> 29:04.830
for a one-semester transition.

29:04.880 --> 29:07.930
♫My longing can overwhelm a thousand mountains♫

29:05.240 --> 29:06.960
After the household registration is done, then transfer him to a public school.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.910
♫It's like it was yesterday♫

29:08.960 --> 29:09.440
Got it.

29:10.570 --> 29:12.240
You can't go back yet, right?

29:11.960 --> 29:14.980
♫Where can we see the full moon?♫

29:12.940 --> 29:14.220
How are you going to find a school for him?

29:17.130 --> 29:17.770
I'll take care of it.

29:23.670 --> 29:24.200
How about this?

29:24.690 --> 29:25.910
I'll recommend the school to you.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.520
I have friends

29:27.570 --> 29:29.170
whose children are in school.

29:29.430 --> 29:30.370
They are familiar with the school.

29:31.140 --> 29:31.770
I'll go through the transfer procedures

29:31.670 --> 29:33.900
♫It was a hurry♫

29:31.800 --> 29:32.970
for you too.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.190
After all, I've done it before

29:34.350 --> 29:35.000
and I'm familiar with the process.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.060
♫I saw you off with a song♫

29:35.850 --> 29:36.560
Thank you so much.

29:38.940 --> 29:41.520
♫Look at each other without words♫

29:42.910 --> 29:45.440
♫This heart is the same♫

29:43.590 --> 29:45.070
When are you going back to Beijing?

29:46.980 --> 29:49.570
♫The fog is thick♫

29:48.340 --> 29:48.980
I haven't finished

29:48.980 --> 29:49.760
my work here.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.370
♫Don't ask about my feelings♫

29:54.560 --> 29:56.760
♫I'll tell you all my sorrows♫

29:55.810 --> 29:56.450
You guys continue.

29:57.120 --> 29:57.600
You and our sister-in-law...

29:59.140 --> 30:01.380
♫In the bright moon♫

30:01.800 --> 30:04.140
♫The years are rippling♫

30:03.300 --> 30:04.230
Talk with our ex-sister-in-law.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.700
♫On both sides of the crowd♫

30:05.960 --> 30:09.270
♫Old wishes are hard to come true♫

30:09.860 --> 30:11.400
♫Old dreams are vanquishable♫

30:11.780 --> 30:13.580
♫And there's nothing left but sighs♫

30:14.280 --> 30:17.760
♫The sound of memories never goes away♫

30:27.290 --> 30:28.970
♫With ink as a sail♫

30:28.260 --> 30:29.270
Have some beef jerky.

30:29.300 --> 30:32.090
♫Tossing and turning between my fingers♫

30:29.680 --> 30:30.570
I'll get you some water.

30:31.170 --> 30:31.620
Lu Chen.

30:32.980 --> 30:34.750
♫The distance between us is far away♫

30:33.900 --> 30:34.490
I'm not thirsty.

30:34.930 --> 30:36.960
♫Even if we don't meet each other♫

30:37.460 --> 30:41.050
♫My longing can overwhelm a thousand mountains♫

30:41.340 --> 30:44.910
♫It's like it was yesterday♫

30:47.090 --> 30:52.310
♫Where can we see the full moon?♫

30:48.590 --> 30:49.300
The atmosphere is good.

31:07.660 --> 31:09.300
Do you two

31:09.330 --> 31:10.660
want me to go back and persuade her?

31:14.420 --> 31:15.740
Are they really first love?

31:18.540 --> 31:19.260
Kind of.

31:20.180 --> 31:21.130
Did Captain Lu tell you?

31:22.820 --> 31:23.820
My son figured it out.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.430
When he first came to Qining,

31:27.580 --> 31:28.450
he lived with Lu Yanchen.

31:29.070 --> 31:30.100
There's a sketch

31:30.350 --> 31:31.190
in Captain Lu's drawer.

31:32.670 --> 31:33.450
It's Gui Xiao.

31:36.300 --> 31:37.190
He didn't even tell me.

31:37.820 --> 31:38.980
A few days ago, he spilled it out.

31:39.750 --> 31:40.370
But Captain Lu's

31:40.410 --> 31:41.600
sketching skills

31:41.700 --> 31:42.840
are definitely the top.

31:44.090 --> 31:45.660
It's almost the same as the photo.

32:04.870 --> 32:06.330
Many brothers are drunk.

32:06.700 --> 32:07.420
I have to watch over them.

32:08.530 --> 32:09.170
No need to see me off.

32:52.140 --> 32:55.420
♫I can give up anything♫

32:55.720 --> 32:59.580
♫But I'm reluctant to leave today♫

32:57.180 --> 32:58.580
Captain Lu. Captain Lu.

33:00.090 --> 33:03.330
♫You're not beautiful♫

33:03.480 --> 33:06.910
♫But you're exceedingly adorable♫

33:07.750 --> 33:10.810
♫Oh, Cinderella♫

33:11.620 --> 33:14.440
♫My Cinderella♫

33:23.030 --> 33:25.860
♫I'm constantly breaking your heart♫

33:26.780 --> 33:29.710
♫I'm always being cruel♫

33:28.140 --> 33:29.010
You didn't drink.

33:29.140 --> 33:29.890
Aren't you going to see them off?

33:30.620 --> 33:33.770
♫I told you not to take it seriously♫

33:32.030 --> 33:32.980
These people are here.

33:33.450 --> 33:34.670
Is the story between you and your ex-girlfriend

33:34.180 --> 33:37.510
♫'Cause I can't believe it♫

33:35.070 --> 33:36.350
really unforgettable?

33:36.780 --> 33:37.860
I've never seen you like this.

33:38.410 --> 33:41.390
♫You're so beautiful♫

33:39.700 --> 33:40.700
Have you ever seen me drunk?

33:41.540 --> 33:42.660
I've never seen that.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.340
♫And you're exceedingly adorable♫

33:43.830 --> 33:45.070
But the word "sense of propriety"

33:45.780 --> 33:47.070
is really custom-made for you.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.770
♫Oh, Cinderella♫

33:50.050 --> 33:52.800
♫My Cinderella♫

33:59.510 --> 34:00.880
You were not here when I first came.

34:02.990 --> 34:03.880
I was so hungry that

34:04.620 --> 34:06.460
I swallowed snake gall and drank goat blood.

34:07.550 --> 34:08.679
I traveled through the deep forest

34:08.699 --> 34:09.880
with a load of 40 kilograms

34:09.310 --> 34:12.170
♫Maybe you didn't♫

34:10.540 --> 34:11.380
and never collapsed.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.040
♫Think my heart would hurt♫

34:15.679 --> 34:16.699
But when I got drunk,

34:17.159 --> 34:19.560
♫If this is a dream♫

34:17.500 --> 34:18.699
I thought of her.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.880
♫I'd like to stay drunk and not wake up♫

34:24.179 --> 34:25.449
In a half-man tall field,

34:26.380 --> 34:27.739
I stayed there alone,

34:29.550 --> 34:30.550
drinking all night

34:31.590 --> 34:32.350
until I blacked out.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.310
♫I used to hold back♫

34:36.179 --> 34:39.100
♫I've waited so long♫

34:39.570 --> 34:42.949
♫Maybe I'm waiting for you to come♫

34:43.370 --> 34:46.469
♫Maybe I'm waiting for you to come♫

34:48.620 --> 34:49.219
Commissioner Du.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.150
Commissioner Du.

34:50.150 --> 34:50.850
Grandpa Du.

34:50.960 --> 34:51.760
So lively.

34:53.889 --> 34:55.530
I'm just passing by. Go on.

34:55.659 --> 34:56.320
Do what you should.

34:59.980 --> 35:00.900
I heard that Captain Lu

35:00.900 --> 35:02.210
had prepared good wine and dishes.

35:02.750 --> 35:03.780
My wife

35:03.780 --> 35:04.920
doesn't care about my dinner.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.140
She asked me to scrounge a free meal.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.820
So she doesn't have to cook.

35:09.780 --> 35:10.410
Sir,

35:11.100 --> 35:11.890
you're wrong.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.420
He bought the wine.

35:13.660 --> 35:14.820
But I cooked the dishes.

35:15.160 --> 35:15.740
I see.

35:16.690 --> 35:17.730
That's not right.

35:17.760 --> 35:18.610
What's wrong?

35:18.970 --> 35:19.940
This is my restaurant.

35:20.050 --> 35:21.070
What I say is always true.

35:21.910 --> 35:23.560
It's rare for them to gather here.

35:23.590 --> 35:24.580
It's just a dinner.

35:25.180 --> 35:25.710
Have a seat.

35:26.140 --> 35:27.420
I'll cook some new dishes.

35:28.430 --> 35:28.980
No need.

35:29.590 --> 35:30.400
Give me some peanuts

35:30.430 --> 35:31.710
and two pieces of mutton will do.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.330
I'd love to do so.

35:33.580 --> 35:34.100
Just wait.

35:34.500 --> 35:34.970
Okay.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.270
Mingyu.

35:43.110 --> 35:45.290
I heard that you are transferring your kid to another school.

35:46.740 --> 35:48.000
I just talked

35:51.110 --> 35:52.170
with Captain Lu's ex.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.300
She is nice.

35:54.710 --> 35:55.630
She didn't mind anything

35:55.650 --> 35:56.650
and agreed to do it.

35:57.260 --> 35:58.130
Ex-girlfriend?

35:59.980 --> 36:00.700
During college

36:00.950 --> 36:01.970
or later?

36:02.420 --> 36:02.910
During college.

36:03.420 --> 36:05.160
I've only been with her. No one else.

36:09.020 --> 36:09.740
Can you handle it?

36:10.140 --> 36:11.420
I'll help contact others if you can't.

36:12.980 --> 36:14.430
I noticed that

36:14.430 --> 36:15.330
you really care about them.

36:15.820 --> 36:16.660
Of course.

36:16.890 --> 36:18.480
We northeasterners are grateful.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.710
I'm going to bed. You're leaving tomorrow.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.120
♫You must have secretly collected♫

36:48.140 --> 36:50.550
♫So much wind and frost♫

♫Waiting to meet someone♫

36:55.510 --> 36:57.770

37:00.090 --> 37:04.830
♫On a night with wine and wind♫

37:07.240 --> 37:09.640
♫Half a moon♫

37:10.900 --> 37:12.700
♫The moon♫

♫You must have wiped it silently♫

37:18.030 --> 37:20.310

37:22.060 --> 37:24.780
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

37:24.810 --> 37:27.650

37:30.040 --> 37:34.980
♫On a night when no one knows♫

37:37.190 --> 37:38.480
It's windy here.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.780
♫The breeze♫

37:48.380 --> 37:50.950
♫To the farthest places♫

37:52.120 --> 37:55.150
♫Bringing back the green plants of summer♫

38:16.380 --> 38:17.680
You call at this hour.

38:18.050 --> 38:19.730
Your dad will be upset.

38:20.490 --> 38:21.860
I have something to discuss with you.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.180
Go ahead.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.620
I can only go back to Beijing during the Chinese New Year.

38:36.730 --> 38:37.820
My friend's child

38:38.300 --> 38:38.990
wants to live in Beijing.

38:39.810 --> 38:40.380
I'll send him back.

38:40.900 --> 38:41.870
Please take care of him for a few days.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.220
It's just a kid.

38:43.790 --> 38:44.700
You know

38:44.700 --> 38:45.770
your dad's temper.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.360
I think we should forget it.

38:48.830 --> 38:49.460
Besides,

38:49.740 --> 38:51.260
children are important

38:51.260 --> 38:52.190
in general families,

38:52.190 --> 38:53.470
like their lifeblood.

38:54.310 --> 38:56.490
Don't simply take care of others' children.

38:57.130 --> 38:58.250
If anything happens,

38:58.280 --> 39:00.220
you can't pass the blame.

39:03.940 --> 39:04.860
Your dad is awake.

39:04.970 --> 39:06.220
I'm hanging up.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.060
See how smart I am.

39:37.490 --> 39:38.730
I named you ZZZ

39:39.100 --> 39:40.350
so that you would be the last one in the phone book.

39:40.860 --> 39:41.630
No one can find you.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.390
Neither can my parents.

40:13.050 --> 40:13.890
Are you still up?

40:20.190 --> 40:21.790
Pack up for Qin Xiaonan.

40:22.390 --> 40:23.400
I'll take him back to Beijing first.

40:23.820 --> 40:24.470
The flight is 4:20 pm

40:24.490 --> 40:25.790
the day after tomorrow.

40:26.440 --> 40:27.840
I'll buy him a ticket later.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.070
Remember to take him to the airport

40:30.100 --> 40:30.860
before 3 o'clock.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.360
Don't miss the flight.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.220
Gui Xiao.

40:48.020 --> 40:48.990
It's late at night.

40:49.830 --> 40:51.000
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold after the shower?

40:51.650 --> 40:52.530
I wasn't showering.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.710
I wanted to wash my face with hot water,

41:00.250 --> 41:00.930
but the water

41:00.950 --> 41:02.270
didn't warm up.

41:15.380 --> 41:15.700
Bye.

41:54.570 --> 41:55.990
Pack up your son's luggage tomorrow.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.370
Gui Xiao is taking Xiaonan to Beijing

41:58.710 --> 41:59.880
the day after tomorrow.

42:01.620 --> 42:02.380
She's probably afraid that

42:02.400 --> 42:03.720
it would be too late

42:04.120 --> 42:04.670
for us to take him there.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.090
Your first love is really nice.

42:10.140 --> 42:10.820
I've asked already.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.580
She's not married yet.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.870
But she helped me

42:15.070 --> 42:15.940
so much with this matter.

42:16.980 --> 42:18.400
It seems that she still likes you.

42:18.820 --> 42:19.540
Grab the chance.

42:25.950 --> 42:26.950
We're not

42:26.950 --> 42:27.750
in our teens anymore.

42:29.320 --> 42:29.910
Once we're together,

42:30.920 --> 42:31.730
what can I provide her?

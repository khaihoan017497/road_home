[ROAD HOME]

01:35.289 --> 01:37.700
[Episode 7]

01:39.530 --> 01:41.740
Mom said Zhao Minshan came to our house

01:41.740 --> 01:42.570
and cried.

01:42.780 --> 01:43.690
Dad was so angry.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.360
Did dad come to you?

01:46.220 --> 01:46.840
I told mom and dad I want to

01:47.460 --> 01:47.900
have a talk with them.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.259
Why didn't you tell me?

01:51.130 --> 01:52.250
Drive back. I'll go with you.

01:53.660 --> 01:55.220
Dad won't treat you any better.

01:55.690 --> 01:56.420
Or even worse.

01:57.180 --> 01:57.650
If you go with me,

01:58.280 --> 01:59.430
I suppose he won't let you go home ever after.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.660
But what if he hits you again?

02:01.980 --> 02:02.380
No, he won't.

02:03.580 --> 02:04.700
I'm not a kid anymore.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.020
Besides, he's old.

02:07.540 --> 02:08.100
He can't hit me anymore.

02:11.940 --> 02:14.290
You protected me when I was young.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.880
You are still the one who protects me when I grow up.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.220
As your older sister,

02:20.220 --> 02:21.020
I'm really useless.

02:23.020 --> 02:23.380
Alright.

02:24.579 --> 02:25.180
Don't cry.

02:26.060 --> 02:26.579
Or my brother-in-law would think I treated you badly

02:26.579 --> 02:27.940
when we go back home.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.270
He won't.

02:32.300 --> 02:32.740
Sister.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.070
We're almost there.

02:34.350 --> 02:35.500
I'll find a place

02:35.500 --> 02:36.310
to drop you off.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.870
I'm afraid it'll be too late when I get back.

02:39.579 --> 02:40.420
Got it, Captain Lu.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.060
We know your dad well.

03:10.260 --> 03:11.420
Just tell us honestly.

03:12.180 --> 03:12.920
We're all here.

03:13.400 --> 03:13.840
We can handle it.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.820
Who are you going to celebrate the New Year with?

03:29.620 --> 03:30.600
Who else?

03:30.820 --> 03:31.420
Just myself.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.000
Serious?

03:40.380 --> 03:41.260
You alone?

03:43.940 --> 03:45.430
I'm not going home this year.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.579
Shall I stay at your place?

03:48.380 --> 03:48.940
Sure.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.610
You really mean it?

03:52.220 --> 03:53.500
Come straight to the point.

03:53.710 --> 03:54.870
What are you trying to say?

03:55.740 --> 03:56.810
I remember someone's first love

03:57.280 --> 03:58.310
went back to Beijing.

03:59.020 --> 03:59.890
You aren't going to see each other during the New Year break?

04:00.620 --> 04:01.940
What a rare holiday!

04:14.980 --> 04:15.620
Hello, sir.

04:15.620 --> 04:16.540
What would you like to drink?

04:16.540 --> 04:17.060
Pu'er tea, thank you.

04:17.300 --> 04:17.660
OK.

04:20.709 --> 04:21.190
What's up?

04:21.260 --> 04:22.140
Didn't you have enough for lunch?

04:22.820 --> 04:23.980
No, I was busy talking about business.

04:23.980 --> 04:24.940
So I just had a little.

04:25.420 --> 04:26.700
You can't just eat this.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.580
Waiter, please bring me the menu.

04:28.940 --> 04:29.420
No, no, no.

04:30.290 --> 04:30.770
Don't bother.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.340
I'm hungry too. Let's eat together.

04:33.930 --> 04:34.560
Lobster pasta.

04:34.700 --> 04:35.220
Your favorite.

04:41.420 --> 04:42.390
Get out.

04:43.310 --> 04:44.220
Who let you in?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.590
There is no rule for serving dishes.

04:50.580 --> 04:51.820
He's too drunk to recognize anyone.

04:51.980 --> 04:53.380
I didn't dare to tell your dad

04:53.730 --> 04:55.140
that you don't want to get married.

04:57.450 --> 04:57.850
Zhao.

04:57.940 --> 04:58.500
Let's drink.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.920
In business,

05:05.980 --> 05:07.140
taste matters the most.

05:07.780 --> 05:08.740
When I was young,

05:08.740 --> 05:10.380
my taste was well-recognized.

05:10.840 --> 05:11.480
Am I right?

05:11.900 --> 05:12.540
Yes.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.220
After the renovation,

05:14.460 --> 05:15.500
the business will be here soon.

05:16.130 --> 05:17.660
I am aware that

05:18.420 --> 05:19.300
the older I am,

05:19.730 --> 05:21.780
the luckier I am.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.330
We haven't fully reached an agreement with Qin Feng.

05:28.930 --> 05:29.610
We can still negotiate.

05:31.060 --> 05:31.640
Maybe

05:32.150 --> 05:33.550
Lu Chen is unhappy

05:33.580 --> 05:34.220
to be arranged.

05:35.140 --> 05:35.790
You two

05:36.530 --> 05:37.700
get to know each other more.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.420
You used to be classmates.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.420
it's much easier to cultivate a relationship.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.050
My son is here.

05:50.260 --> 05:50.740
I thought

05:50.760 --> 05:52.000
no one could invite you to come.

05:52.460 --> 05:53.060
This kid

05:53.290 --> 05:55.120
has never been home since he was transferred back.

05:55.190 --> 05:56.390
I don't know where he lives.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.700
His temper has improved.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.110
With two rats hanging around his waist,

06:00.140 --> 06:01.300
others would think he is a hunter.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.440
Well, you're now thoughtful enough

06:14.670 --> 06:16.220
to make a toast to your in-law.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.560
Say something.

06:21.820 --> 06:22.770
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:23.660 --> 06:24.020
I'm sorry.

06:25.700 --> 06:26.660
I must break off the engagement.

06:32.540 --> 06:33.420
You dare to repeat

06:33.420 --> 06:34.100
what you just said.

06:36.659 --> 06:37.880
I must break off the engagement.

06:40.740 --> 06:41.780
How dare you!

06:41.780 --> 06:42.940
Do you think I dare not beat you?

06:42.940 --> 06:43.420
Kid

06:44.010 --> 06:45.330
-I… -Uncle Sanxing, what are you doing?

06:45.350 --> 06:46.420
-Calm down. -You…

06:46.420 --> 06:47.740
How can you pour wine on your son?

06:47.740 --> 06:48.470
Go away.

06:48.820 --> 06:49.110
I...

06:49.300 --> 06:50.050
Uncle Sanxing

06:50.430 --> 06:51.590
Calm down.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.170
Lu Chen is my brother.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.780
If you don't give him face,

06:54.780 --> 06:56.060
you have to save me some face.

06:56.060 --> 06:56.580
Right?

06:56.580 --> 06:57.250
Uncle Sanxing,

06:57.420 --> 06:57.940
you and my dad

06:57.940 --> 06:58.860
are old friends.

06:58.860 --> 06:59.780
You can't

06:59.780 --> 07:00.500
destroy my shop.

07:00.850 --> 07:01.930
Ignore Lu Chen.

07:02.060 --> 07:02.780
Later I'll have Qin Feng

07:02.780 --> 07:04.130
open the best standard room for you.

07:04.260 --> 07:05.340
I'm not running business today.

07:05.340 --> 07:06.160
I'll serve you instead

07:06.340 --> 07:07.620
with the best wine.

07:07.620 --> 07:08.620
Ask Qin Feng to drink with you.

07:08.650 --> 07:09.850
Drink as much as you like.

07:09.940 --> 07:10.740
It's not about drinking.

07:10.740 --> 07:11.090
That's right.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.300
I'll drink with you.

07:12.300 --> 07:12.770
Uncle Sanxing.

07:13.020 --> 07:13.700
Listen to me.

07:14.540 --> 07:15.140
You need to

07:15.140 --> 07:16.460
save face for your son.

07:16.460 --> 07:17.260
Otherwise,

07:17.260 --> 07:18.340
it will have a negative impact.

07:18.340 --> 07:18.720
Right?

07:19.100 --> 07:19.980
No matter what,

07:19.980 --> 07:20.500
Lu Chen

07:20.500 --> 07:22.300
is a hero now.

07:22.300 --> 07:22.690
Right?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.140
Hero?

07:24.140 --> 07:25.240
I don't need your protection.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.340
Let me teach you how to be a son

07:27.660 --> 07:28.830
and how to talk to your elders.

07:28.980 --> 07:29.460
Fine.

07:29.460 --> 07:29.860
OK.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.900
I'm educating my son.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.260
It has nothing to do with you.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.700
Wait and see.

07:35.740 --> 07:36.520
Wait and see.

07:36.810 --> 07:37.650
Uncle Sanxing, this way.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.110
Uncle, aunt,

07:43.540 --> 07:44.620
let's go next door.

07:45.420 --> 07:46.300
After all,

07:46.320 --> 07:47.830
marriage is their business.

07:48.060 --> 07:48.650
Let them have a talk.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.400
What else do you want me to say?

08:16.820 --> 08:18.060
We can't talk if you act like this.

08:21.220 --> 08:21.660
Lu Chen,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.340
I know your family well.

08:24.820 --> 08:25.980
And you also

08:25.980 --> 08:26.650
know my family well.

08:27.060 --> 08:27.980
Our families

08:27.980 --> 08:29.860
know each other well.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.850
It's not about who is not good enough for another.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.620
You're already 30.

08:35.320 --> 08:35.740
It is impossible for you to

08:35.740 --> 08:36.780
give all your savings

08:36.780 --> 08:37.620
to my family.

08:38.140 --> 08:38.860
What will you do?

08:40.220 --> 08:41.419
Your dad

08:41.419 --> 08:42.159
will not give you a penny.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.580
In the end,

08:44.580 --> 08:45.380
you still have to get married

08:45.380 --> 08:46.520
and have kids.

08:46.980 --> 08:47.880
How can you get married without money?

08:51.070 --> 08:52.240
You've never been married.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.280
Let me tell you.

08:53.380 --> 08:54.740
Once you get married,

08:54.740 --> 08:55.350
you'll know.

08:55.820 --> 08:56.820
No matter who you marry,

08:56.850 --> 08:58.530
you'll live your own life in the end.

09:05.500 --> 09:05.980
Lu Chen,

09:06.740 --> 09:07.600
this time

09:07.980 --> 09:09.490
I really want to get married.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.120
We've known each other since school.

09:12.740 --> 09:13.540
Marrying me

09:13.540 --> 09:14.700
is better than

09:14.700 --> 09:15.220
marrying a stranger.

09:16.090 --> 09:16.760
Besides,

09:16.860 --> 09:18.240
you have to borrow money

09:18.500 --> 09:19.420
if you want to pay off your dad's debts.

09:19.990 --> 09:20.880
You don't need to ask.

09:20.910 --> 09:21.860
Everyone knows

09:21.860 --> 09:22.420
you're in debt.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.220
Who dares to marry you at that time?

09:28.430 --> 09:29.400
Do you...

09:30.420 --> 09:31.910
Do you really look down on me?

09:32.580 --> 09:33.580
What's wrong with me?

09:33.970 --> 09:34.450
Yes.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.270
We got engaged without telling you.

09:36.300 --> 09:36.980
But it is your dad

09:37.000 --> 09:38.080
who owes us money first.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.220
If you break off the engagement,

09:40.220 --> 09:41.420
you are really embarrassing me.

09:43.130 --> 09:44.480
Your parents are planning a banquet.

09:45.660 --> 09:46.980
The kid you saw that day

09:47.980 --> 09:48.980
will still live with me

09:48.980 --> 09:49.700
at least five to six years.

09:54.340 --> 09:55.140
It's not your child.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.280
Why are you in such a hurry to raise her.

09:59.980 --> 10:00.580
Just say

10:01.730 --> 10:03.020
there's something wrong with Lu Yanchen.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.820
He insists

10:05.220 --> 10:05.740
to raise his brother's kid.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.140
You can't marry him.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.210
Qin Feng called his father over.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.700
They are drinking with your dad.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.260
It seems that

10:19.260 --> 10:20.440
they won't finish until noon tomorrow.

10:20.540 --> 10:21.210
You can go back first.

10:22.340 --> 10:23.900
Today we've got everything open on the table

10:23.900 --> 10:24.800
face to face.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.050
It is a big step.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.250
But we still have to clean up the mess,

10:28.950 --> 10:29.830
recharge and store up energy.

10:30.380 --> 10:30.940
We can't rush.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.110
Thank you.

10:33.060 --> 10:33.850
And especially thank Qin Feng.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.630
Without my relationship with Guixiao,

10:36.660 --> 10:37.940
Qin Feng is also willing to help you.

10:39.860 --> 10:40.880
All right, you should leave now.

10:40.900 --> 10:41.260
Otherwise,

10:41.300 --> 10:42.580
it would be awkward if you ran into Zhao Minshan's parents

10:42.580 --> 10:43.500
when they came out.

10:48.570 --> 10:49.050
Lu Chen.

10:54.700 --> 10:55.800
If we can be together again,

10:56.640 --> 10:57.790
I will treat her well.

11:14.260 --> 11:14.820
Look.

11:15.350 --> 11:16.300
Lu Chen

11:16.760 --> 11:18.320
is determined not to get married.

11:25.230 --> 11:25.840
Minshan,

11:27.350 --> 11:29.220
Lu Chen didn't tell me about it.

11:30.260 --> 11:31.580
So I have no idea

11:31.600 --> 11:33.070
what he said today.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.040
Look.

11:34.540 --> 11:36.020
His dad is so angry.

11:38.140 --> 11:39.110
I understand him.

11:40.940 --> 11:41.870
But I like him.

11:42.020 --> 11:43.020
I want to marry him.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.240
Lu Chen just came back.

11:47.420 --> 11:48.380
He is very busy these days.

11:48.850 --> 11:50.810
Now he's mad at me and his dad again.

11:50.920 --> 11:51.390
Well,

11:51.810 --> 11:54.580
I'll talk to him again.

11:55.650 --> 11:56.570
Come to our factory

11:57.220 --> 11:58.420
for lunch or dinner

11:58.420 --> 11:59.140
this weekend.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.100
Get familiar with each other.

12:01.650 --> 12:03.100
you'll get along well soon.

12:22.660 --> 12:23.810
Your dad called me.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.600
My dad?

12:28.900 --> 12:30.220
Why did he call you?

12:31.730 --> 12:33.660
He wants you to go home for the Spring Festival.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.580
Why would he call you if

12:38.580 --> 12:39.540
he wants me to go home for the Spring Festival.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.710
Tell him,

12:42.860 --> 12:44.220
you're busy during the Spring Festival.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.380
You have to work overtime.

12:45.980 --> 12:47.070
As your boss,

12:47.250 --> 12:48.500
shouldn't I be held accountable?

12:53.710 --> 12:54.510
I'm sorry.

12:54.700 --> 12:55.870
Because of my family matter,

12:56.020 --> 12:57.370
you are disturbed by my dad.

12:57.810 --> 12:58.210
Not at all.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.440
Your dad is my dad's leader.

13:00.620 --> 13:01.940
and my beloved Uncle Gui.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.300
It's never a disturbance

13:03.300 --> 13:04.380
if he calls me.

13:07.490 --> 13:08.370
Would you like some dessert?

13:10.170 --> 13:10.610
No.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.670
I just called back

13:36.230 --> 13:37.860
and heard you two talking about your dad.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.540
Did I hear it right?

13:39.860 --> 13:40.620
You and Wu Chengye

13:40.620 --> 13:41.620
talk about your parents?

13:43.530 --> 13:45.370
His father used to work for my dad.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.670
But there are several layers apart.

13:47.700 --> 13:48.390
I only found out

13:48.900 --> 13:50.380
after graduation.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.170
He wants to court the daughter of an old leader.

14:00.950 --> 14:01.510
Are you asleep?

14:15.260 --> 14:15.780
Not yet.

14:35.730 --> 14:37.800
Things begin to settle down.

14:39.330 --> 14:39.780
I...

14:47.500 --> 14:48.020
Sleep early.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.300
What's the good news?

15:10.620 --> 15:11.710
Why are you smiling so happily?

15:14.300 --> 15:15.220
A friend of mine

15:15.860 --> 15:16.820
asked me if I was asleep.

15:16.820 --> 15:17.970
I said I wasn't.

15:17.990 --> 15:18.540
He said

15:19.220 --> 15:20.170
then sleep early.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.460
Try to make a conversation.

15:25.820 --> 15:26.740
Something's up.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.060
Keep sleeping.

17:23.260 --> 17:24.940
Do you want to hear about Aunt Guixiao?

17:28.740 --> 17:29.260
Sleep.

17:40.380 --> 17:41.180
I'll draw you

17:41.180 --> 17:42.000
a floor plan of her house.

17:53.610 --> 17:55.580
This is the entrance.

17:56.100 --> 17:56.820
Come in here.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.620
There's a big living room.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.030
And there are

18:02.600 --> 18:03.270
two floors.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.580
There's a bookshelf here

18:08.020 --> 18:09.770
with many books on it.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.490
There is a kitchen here.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.320
Lu Chen, well...

18:25.500 --> 18:25.820
Mom.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.170
I know what you want to say.

18:29.380 --> 18:29.820
Impossible.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.090
At least try it.

18:40.940 --> 18:41.420
Looking for me?

18:43.880 --> 18:44.740
All right, go in first.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.140
Do me a favor.

18:48.750 --> 18:49.300
OK.

18:49.330 --> 18:49.680
Tell me.

18:50.870 --> 18:52.130
You know Zhao Minshan well.

18:52.420 --> 18:53.290
Send a message to her for me.

18:54.650 --> 18:55.350
No, I...

18:56.790 --> 18:57.190
Zhao Min...

18:58.180 --> 18:59.340
Who knows her?

18:59.340 --> 19:00.560
We haven't been in touch for 800 years.

19:01.820 --> 19:02.530
For Lu Chen.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.510
You go talk to her for Lu Chen.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.020
Tell her

19:07.020 --> 19:07.860
Lu Chen is going to delay it.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.220
But she's a woman.

19:09.220 --> 19:09.840
She can't afford it.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.890
Let her think it through.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.100
Let her wait for two or three years.

19:13.160 --> 19:13.820
Can she take it?

19:15.540 --> 19:16.350
I don't want to see her.

19:18.930 --> 19:20.140
You were quite happy to meet her

19:20.140 --> 19:21.540
when I didn't allow you to.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.300
Why are you gabbling nonsense

19:22.330 --> 19:23.510
when I ask you to meet her now?

19:28.140 --> 19:29.380
For Lu Chen.

19:33.970 --> 19:34.530
For Lu Chen.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.100
Long time no see.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.870
Haven't we met at the hospital that day?

19:56.530 --> 19:57.220
What do you want to see me about?

19:58.380 --> 19:59.260
For Lu Chen?

20:00.540 --> 20:01.100
Of course.

20:02.020 --> 20:02.780
Personally,

20:02.780 --> 20:03.900
I have nothing to talk to you about.

20:10.100 --> 20:10.820
Let me be frank.

20:12.020 --> 20:12.580
Zhao Minshan,

20:13.330 --> 20:14.700
I know Lu Chen better than you do.

20:15.420 --> 20:16.700
And I know you better than Lu Chen does.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.360
It's impossible for him

20:19.060 --> 20:19.770
to marry you.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.020
We're adults.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.390
You're still so childish.

20:24.050 --> 20:24.710
Tell me then.

20:24.980 --> 20:25.620
How am I childish?

20:27.900 --> 20:28.740
I know Lu Chen.

20:28.940 --> 20:29.500
He is proud

20:29.520 --> 20:30.450
and doesn't want to marry me like this.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.040
I understand.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.560
Then let's take our time

20:32.590 --> 20:33.260
and get to know each other.

20:33.620 --> 20:34.580
From dating.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.530
Funny.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.180
Listen to me.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.810
I know you well.

20:42.460 --> 20:43.860
That's why I came to you.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.740
I know

20:46.770 --> 20:47.860
Lu Chen's temper.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.630
Since he has refused,

20:50.100 --> 20:51.810
there's no turning back.

20:52.490 --> 20:54.050
It's not good for you to delay like this.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.100
Delay for months,

20:56.820 --> 20:57.540
or for years.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.280
Can you take it?

21:02.940 --> 21:03.700
No need.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.240
We're not kids anymore.

21:05.980 --> 21:06.580
Zhao Minshan,

21:07.380 --> 21:08.150
with your family

21:08.460 --> 21:09.300
and your conditions,

21:09.820 --> 21:11.500
It's easy for you to remarry.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.000
I can tell that you like Lu Chen.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.630
But he doesn't like you.

21:16.420 --> 21:17.210
And you can't afford to delay it.

21:27.270 --> 21:27.780
That's it.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.300
Happy New Year in advance.

21:49.090 --> 21:49.590
You want to see me?

21:51.850 --> 21:53.010
I told my dad everything.

21:54.000 --> 21:54.940
I guess after he sobers up,

21:54.940 --> 21:55.460
he would be very angry.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.210
I'll leave the kid to you before school starts.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.350
She'll go home with you.

21:59.940 --> 22:00.360
OK.

22:00.730 --> 22:01.180
What about you?

22:02.180 --> 22:02.710
I'm going back to the SWAT team.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.650
Where do you have dinner for the New Year's Eve?

22:05.670 --> 22:06.150
At my home？

22:07.560 --> 22:08.540
You're celebrating the New Year.

22:09.130 --> 22:09.840
We're on duty.

22:10.710 --> 22:11.550
You don't even come back for Chinese New Year.

22:13.130 --> 22:13.730
I'll be back on the eighth day of the New Year.

22:28.280 --> 22:28.850
What's this for?

22:29.380 --> 22:29.860
A gift in return.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.140
Countdown.

22:33.880 --> 22:34.380
Three minutes.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.480
You even sewed it?

23:14.620 --> 23:15.430
Just for practice.

23:15.940 --> 23:16.630
It's been a long time.

23:17.140 --> 23:17.850
You did a pretty good job.

23:26.940 --> 23:27.740
Have you ever raised a police dog?

23:28.340 --> 23:28.790
No.

23:29.510 --> 23:30.270
Since I came here,

23:30.300 --> 23:31.660
there's a police dog squadron here.

23:32.730 --> 23:33.120
Right?

23:33.440 --> 23:34.040
It's always been there.

23:34.740 --> 23:35.300
You did?

23:36.840 --> 23:37.790
At first,

23:38.070 --> 23:39.000
Qining has no police dog squadron.

23:39.940 --> 23:40.940
My old captain and I

23:41.010 --> 23:41.670
kept some police dogs.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.970
When I was in charge of security,

23:44.250 --> 23:45.110
I had a search dog.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.230
Another one is

23:47.860 --> 23:48.570
an explosive ordnance search dog.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.660
Really?

23:50.020 --> 23:51.350
I want to keep one after hearing what you said.

23:53.460 --> 23:54.490
I heard you applied for

23:54.610 --> 23:56.130
the single dormitory in front of the team gate.

23:56.650 --> 23:56.990
Yes.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.660
I thought you had a partner.

24:01.590 --> 24:02.410
So you're just like me.

24:05.090 --> 24:05.520
Captain Lin.

24:05.980 --> 24:06.340
Captain Lin.

24:07.300 --> 24:07.820
You two

24:07.820 --> 24:08.420
come here together.

24:08.860 --> 24:09.460
Let me introduce,

24:10.200 --> 24:10.600
Captain Lu.

24:12.680 --> 24:13.970
I'm Zhou Xin, the Captain of the Second Squadron.

24:14.740 --> 24:15.730
My name is Du Yiwen,

24:15.860 --> 24:16.700
the Captain of the First Squadron.

24:17.470 --> 24:18.600
You two look quite happy.

24:19.170 --> 24:19.700
What are you talking about?

24:20.560 --> 24:21.200
Just now,

24:21.230 --> 24:22.740
I got a call from an insurance salesman.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.280
When I said I was an EOD technician,

24:24.380 --> 24:25.120
he immediately said

24:25.380 --> 24:25.820
I'm sorry

24:26.010 --> 24:26.760
for disturbing you...

24:26.910 --> 24:27.720
and hung up.

24:29.420 --> 24:30.070
What a high-risk occupation.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.420
Heartbreaking.

24:37.820 --> 24:39.460
One, two, one.

24:40.420 --> 24:44.500
One, two, three, four.

24:45.740 --> 24:46.620
Halt.

25:17.370 --> 25:20.760
[Xiao Xiao]

25:23.580 --> 25:23.980
Hello.

25:24.810 --> 25:25.760
Are you available now?

25:27.220 --> 25:27.620
Yes.

25:28.310 --> 25:28.740
Go ahead.

25:29.650 --> 25:31.640
I made an appointment with Qin Xiaonan's class teacher.

25:31.690 --> 25:32.460
We'll meet after the Chinese New Year.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.060
He is going to

25:34.060 --> 25:34.900
teach Qin Xiaonan.

25:35.380 --> 25:36.220
And he wants to meet his parents.

25:36.780 --> 25:37.980
His parents won't be available,

25:38.720 --> 25:39.530
especially his dad Qin Mingyu.

25:40.230 --> 25:40.830
He'll be on duty during the Chinese New Year.

25:42.090 --> 25:42.820
Well,

25:44.110 --> 25:45.020
let's go instead.

25:47.580 --> 25:48.070
Us?

25:48.550 --> 25:49.100
Yes.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.730
Uncle and Aunt

25:52.670 --> 25:53.510
also count.

25:56.830 --> 25:57.230
OK.

26:00.530 --> 26:01.170
Alright.

26:01.470 --> 26:01.950
Bye.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.300
Gui Xiao.

26:08.280 --> 26:08.740
When

26:10.400 --> 26:11.190
When is your flight?

26:12.110 --> 26:12.790
The return flight.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.250
Tomorrow.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.370
Tomorrow afternoon.

26:19.500 --> 26:19.940
Good.

26:20.630 --> 26:21.880
I have something to do in Beijing tomorrow.

26:22.270 --> 26:23.170
I'll take you back.

26:24.810 --> 26:26.580
Are you coming to pick me up?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.140
Just right on my way.

26:29.230 --> 26:30.660
Remember to send me the flight number,

26:30.920 --> 26:31.880
so I can get there in advance.

26:34.010 --> 26:34.410
OK.

26:40.100 --> 26:40.540
Alright.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.160
I have to go.

26:43.010 --> 26:44.220
Remember to send me the flight number.

26:44.760 --> 26:45.160
Bye.

26:46.260 --> 26:46.660
Bye.

26:56.980 --> 26:58.420
Captain Zhi knows you like dogs.

26:59.190 --> 27:00.070
This is your Spring Festival gift.

27:01.650 --> 27:02.580
Is it a gift

27:03.000 --> 27:04.240
or a new training task?

27:05.290 --> 27:06.680
Anyway, Captain Zhi said

27:06.980 --> 27:08.360
you'll live right next to the police force.

27:08.510 --> 27:09.380
You have plenty of time

27:09.730 --> 27:10.570
and also rich experience in training dogs.

27:11.450 --> 27:12.260
Most importantly,

27:12.570 --> 27:13.890
the number of people and dogs

27:13.910 --> 27:14.500
re fixed.

27:14.780 --> 27:15.800
A team member has transferred to another team,

27:16.080 --> 27:16.700
so no one can take care of this puppy

27:16.700 --> 27:17.680
before the Spring Festival.

27:18.970 --> 27:19.460
Alright.

27:19.620 --> 27:20.550
Leave it with me.

27:20.830 --> 27:21.970
When it has a new owner,

27:22.380 --> 27:23.180
I will then return it safe and sound.

27:23.740 --> 27:24.340
Thank you, Captain Lu.

27:27.570 --> 27:28.050
Anything else?

27:28.940 --> 27:29.300
No.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.560
There are many cars going out.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.140
Go earlier if you need to pick someone up.

27:56.820 --> 27:57.780
Happy wedding!

27:57.780 --> 27:58.470
Doctor Xu.

27:58.980 --> 27:59.560
Thank you.

27:59.660 --> 28:00.450
Miss Gui Xiao.

28:07.650 --> 28:08.290
What time does your flight take off?

28:09.630 --> 28:10.390
Still an hour left.

28:11.380 --> 28:12.010
To be honest,

28:12.480 --> 28:13.660
thank you so much

28:14.100 --> 28:16.230
for making time for me.

28:16.910 --> 28:17.860
Lu Chen is on his way.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.140
He asked me to meet you first.

28:20.540 --> 28:21.460
I'll introduce him to you later.

28:21.790 --> 28:22.160
OK.

28:23.630 --> 28:24.240
Wait a minute.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.430
I'm here.

28:41.870 --> 28:42.900
I'm afraid he can't find me.

28:44.570 --> 28:45.540
Are you meeting

28:45.540 --> 28:46.590
a ten-year-old kid?

28:47.140 --> 28:48.820
He has never been to this terminal.

28:49.150 --> 28:50.380
I guess he doesn't fly much

28:50.380 --> 28:52.140
on ordinary planes either.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.130
He's afraid of flying?

28:57.820 --> 28:59.940
He was in Beijing when he was a student.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.250
At that time,

29:01.270 --> 29:02.390
there were few people travel by plane.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.700
Then he went to Qining

29:05.570 --> 29:06.940
for more than ten years.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.490
He just came back this year.

29:10.320 --> 29:10.990
Let's talk about you first.

29:16.470 --> 29:17.980
This is my bank of deposit

29:18.060 --> 29:18.820
and my bank account.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.360
I need to save some money recently.

29:24.620 --> 29:25.180
So,

29:26.380 --> 29:27.800
I can only lend you two thirds of it.

29:29.090 --> 29:29.890
Next month,

29:29.910 --> 29:31.320
I'll have a financial product expired.

29:31.350 --> 29:32.260
I'll make it up to you.

29:32.450 --> 29:33.040
Will it be too late?

29:33.430 --> 29:34.170
No problem.

29:37.700 --> 29:38.300
When I saw you

29:38.300 --> 29:39.150
walking over there just now,

29:39.300 --> 29:39.940
I remembered

29:39.940 --> 29:41.220
the first time we met.

29:41.890 --> 29:42.450
I was thinking that

29:43.100 --> 29:43.740
the little girl who was crying

29:43.740 --> 29:45.020
at that time

29:45.380 --> 29:46.660
had grown up well.

29:46.710 --> 29:47.920
And you're doing well enough

29:48.180 --> 29:49.010
to lent me money.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.180
I was afraid you couldn't find it

30:04.180 --> 30:05.180
and wanted to pick you up.

30:28.470 --> 30:29.170
I have something else to do.

30:29.340 --> 30:30.710
Take your time.

30:32.340 --> 30:33.250
Don't you want a drink?

30:33.280 --> 30:33.760
No.

30:34.150 --> 30:35.460
I haven't introduced him to you.

30:35.490 --> 30:36.300
There are plenty of opportunities.

30:37.280 --> 30:37.680
See you.

30:51.390 --> 30:52.030
Do you want some coffee?

30:56.940 --> 30:58.100
You guys don't drink coffee?

30:59.670 --> 31:00.650
I drink black coffee.

31:01.530 --> 31:02.530
You do drink coffee.

31:04.370 --> 31:05.410
Do you have any misunderstanding

31:06.180 --> 31:07.280
about our work?

31:08.960 --> 31:10.180
I just have no idea.

31:10.570 --> 31:11.420
I'm curious.

31:58.980 --> 32:02.090
[2009]

32:01.730 --> 32:04.160
♫Hey, what day is it today?♫

32:03.730 --> 32:04.760
Why didn't you drive here?

32:04.800 --> 32:07.400
♫Can I see you?♫

32:05.280 --> 32:06.050
It's too eye-catching.

32:07.830 --> 32:10.590
♫Let the heartbeat continue 110♫

32:11.090 --> 32:13.150
♫It's so troublesome♫

32:14.240 --> 32:16.860
♫You haven't got up yet♫

32:17.390 --> 32:20.190
♫You didn't see my message♫

32:20.390 --> 32:23.200
♫Did anyone tell you♫

32:23.750 --> 32:25.900
♫I miss you very much♫

32:26.900 --> 32:27.650
Is he gone?

32:26.900 --> 32:29.650
♫Love is in vogue♫

32:28.460 --> 32:28.860
Yes, he's gone.

32:30.020 --> 32:32.240
♫You still need to be quiet♫

32:32.820 --> 32:35.610
♫Even the moon is awakened♫

32:33.480 --> 32:33.900
Chen.

32:36.290 --> 32:38.570
♫Even meteors stop♫

32:39.380 --> 32:42.250
♫Love songs are popular♫

32:41.980 --> 32:43.020
Fortunately, no one saw us.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.950
♫I'll sing for you♫

32:44.030 --> 32:44.670
Afraid of being seen?

32:45.390 --> 32:48.510
♫We need to cultivate our relationship♫

32:46.780 --> 32:47.340
No.

32:47.870 --> 32:48.600
There's nothing to be afraid of.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.210
♫I believe you can do it♫

33:08.550 --> 33:09.800
You said you're here for work.

33:09.980 --> 33:10.570
Will it be too late?

33:10.830 --> 33:11.790
I can call a taxi.

33:13.200 --> 33:13.610
It's done.

33:17.350 --> 33:18.300
Let's go after I finish this.

33:20.820 --> 33:21.500
It's my day off.

33:22.370 --> 33:22.820
No hurry.

33:23.660 --> 33:24.260
Take your time.

34:02.150 --> 34:03.060
Are you free on the second day of the New Year?

34:06.040 --> 34:07.650
For the meeting with Qin Xiaonan's class teacher.

34:08.949 --> 34:09.460
How about the eighth day?

34:11.239 --> 34:11.550
OK.

34:13.260 --> 34:13.770
I'm leaving.

34:19.639 --> 34:20.070
Gui Xiao.

34:24.360 --> 34:24.909
Happy New Year.

34:29.010 --> 34:29.850
I'm on duty during the Spring Festival.

34:30.989 --> 34:32.110
It's not easy to contact me.

34:33.270 --> 34:33.750
Tell me in advance.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.810
Happy Spring Festival in advance.

34:41.500 --> 34:41.830
Bye.

35:13.950 --> 35:14.960
Take care when you work overtime.

35:17.590 --> 35:17.900
OK.

35:36.950 --> 35:37.710
After the Spring Festival,

35:38.380 --> 35:39.340
we will practice

35:39.340 --> 35:40.530
how to catch the suspicious object

35:41.390 --> 35:42.340
and put it in the EOD tank.

35:42.590 --> 35:43.340
The imaging device

35:44.030 --> 35:45.220
can help us determine

35:45.850 --> 35:46.540
if the explosives

35:47.080 --> 35:48.430
can be removed manually.

35:50.450 --> 35:52.770
As a professional EOD technician,

35:54.010 --> 35:54.580
observing

35:55.740 --> 35:56.390
is a compulsory course.

35:58.140 --> 35:58.670
Normally,

35:58.870 --> 35:59.730
each team is in charge of

35:59.940 --> 36:01.030
different equipment.

36:01.990 --> 36:03.030
We not only need to know how to use it,

36:04.020 --> 36:04.690
but also

36:04.720 --> 36:06.240
how to maintain your robots,

36:07.160 --> 36:08.950
including EOD robots.

36:10.340 --> 36:11.540
The condition is much better now.

36:12.200 --> 36:12.640
In the past,

36:13.540 --> 36:14.750
the tools used by

36:15.440 --> 36:16.080
our first generation of EOD technicians

36:16.980 --> 36:18.530
are the same as those used to repair cars.

36:19.570 --> 36:20.270
Without these,

36:20.670 --> 36:21.510
what can we rely on?

36:23.000 --> 36:23.730
We learn and study

36:24.430 --> 36:24.800
by ourselves.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.980
But in the field of EOD,

36:28.640 --> 36:30.360
no matter how advanced the equipment is,

36:31.100 --> 36:33.090
people are irreplaceable.

36:34.300 --> 36:34.820
For example,

36:35.950 --> 36:37.590
robots can't work for

36:38.470 --> 36:40.460
the bomb disposal we met at height.

36:41.620 --> 36:42.810
We have to do it ourselves.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.170
Do you understand?

36:46.430 --> 36:47.180
Yes.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.130
OK.

36:48.450 --> 36:49.620
There's an extra meal

36:50.220 --> 36:50.820
in the canteen tonight.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.250
Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.

36:55.270 --> 36:56.910
Happy Chinese New Year, Captain Lu.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.360
Everyone works overtime during the Spring Festival?

37:01.060 --> 37:01.790
Yes.

37:03.160 --> 37:03.850
We are SWAT police.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.220
It's very memorable

37:07.020 --> 37:08.120
to work overtime during the Spring Festival.

37:09.300 --> 37:09.970
Remember what I said.

37:10.930 --> 37:12.300
Don't close your eyes for 36 hours.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.430
You'll be too tired to sleep after work.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.090
So that you'll remember this experience later.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.760
OK, let's go and eat.

37:25.740 --> 37:26.820
Happy New Year, everyone.

37:27.740 --> 37:28.740
The physical examination report is out.

37:29.560 --> 37:30.320
All of you have passed.

37:33.110 --> 37:34.190
Since I'm here this year,

37:35.110 --> 37:36.640
you can take turns to take a break.

37:37.690 --> 37:38.590
I'll keep an eye on

37:38.990 --> 37:39.940
during the Spring Festival.

37:41.190 --> 37:42.030
But on the eighth day,

37:42.760 --> 37:43.410
I need someone

37:43.860 --> 37:45.140
to keep an eye here for me.

37:45.800 --> 37:46.810
I need to go to school

37:47.130 --> 37:47.840
to meet the class teacher.

37:52.120 --> 37:52.760
What's the problem?

37:53.370 --> 37:53.900
Captain Lu,

37:54.420 --> 37:55.790
I remember you are unmarried

37:55.810 --> 37:56.720
on the file.

37:57.970 --> 37:58.690
A friend's child.

37:59.030 --> 37:59.630
I help take care of him.

38:00.940 --> 38:01.870
What a brotherly love!

38:02.400 --> 38:03.680
Aren't you afraid that your future partner

38:03.730 --> 38:04.240
will complain about it?

38:05.940 --> 38:06.370
Alright.

38:06.890 --> 38:07.740
It's time for some of you to eat

38:08.020 --> 38:08.930
and some on duty.

38:09.300 --> 38:09.700
Dismissed.

38:11.210 --> 38:11.680
This is

38:11.950 --> 38:13.210
the physical examination report of the new team members.

38:14.040 --> 38:14.590
Pretty good.

38:14.630 --> 38:15.360
All passed.

38:15.890 --> 38:16.830
Are there any tricks?

38:16.990 --> 38:17.540
Share some with us.

38:19.530 --> 38:20.280
Do you pay tuition fees?

38:21.470 --> 38:22.110
So stingy.

38:22.970 --> 38:23.650
Keep it.

38:24.680 --> 38:25.320
You still don't treat us

38:25.340 --> 38:25.940
as your own people.

38:27.190 --> 38:28.760
You're quite suitable for crosstalk.

38:30.010 --> 38:30.980
I just want to see

38:31.470 --> 38:32.180
if there are anyone

38:32.200 --> 38:33.080
with good psychological quality.

38:36.820 --> 38:37.550
This one has excellent physical condition.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.760
He's born to be a EOD technician.

38:41.090 --> 38:42.380
His heart rate is

38:43.790 --> 38:45.950
around 60 per minute. So low.

38:49.650 --> 38:50.580
These are good too.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.580
They all look steady.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.360
They are born to do this.

38:55.270 --> 38:55.670
OK.

38:56.730 --> 38:57.730
I'll go to the command center downstairs

38:57.750 --> 38:58.370
and have a look.

38:58.430 --> 39:00.060
See you downstairs in ten minutes.

39:00.240 --> 39:00.590
Yes.

39:16.950 --> 39:17.990
Routine patrol.

39:20.530 --> 39:21.380
Everyone,

39:21.380 --> 39:22.140
pause for a moment.

39:22.140 --> 39:23.220
We're having a routine check.

39:23.220 --> 39:24.020
Please rehearse later.

39:27.270 --> 39:28.910
You lead inspections of key areas.

39:29.100 --> 39:29.460
Yes.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.740
The rest of you, follow me.

39:30.960 --> 39:31.560
Yes.

39:31.590 --> 39:32.670
Check carefully.

39:32.780 --> 39:33.490
Yes.

39:33.670 --> 39:34.510
You come here now.

39:34.530 --> 39:35.200
When will you leave?

39:35.260 --> 39:35.630
No, we won't leave.

39:35.830 --> 39:36.470
Fully stand by.

39:44.270 --> 39:44.640
Go.

39:59.310 --> 39:59.690
Captain Lu.

40:08.440 --> 40:08.850
OK.

40:10.060 --> 40:10.730
Open the trunk.

40:10.900 --> 40:11.210
Yes.

40:20.860 --> 40:21.460
Not a big problem.

40:21.500 --> 40:21.940
Nothing unusual.

40:28.180 --> 40:29.030
Prepare the detector.

40:29.300 --> 40:29.610
Yes.

40:29.940 --> 40:30.680
Attention.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.000
Check every car.

40:32.350 --> 40:32.780
Yes.

40:46.540 --> 40:46.940
Stand up.

40:49.590 --> 40:50.020
Relax.

40:50.430 --> 40:50.780
Sit.

40:51.230 --> 40:51.820
Yes.

41:00.850 --> 41:01.610
Everyone is tired.

41:02.890 --> 41:04.210
First time listening to a party backstage?

41:04.660 --> 41:05.230
Yes.

41:08.980 --> 41:10.060
Take a ten-minute break.

41:10.740 --> 41:12.150
We'll have the second round later.

41:12.750 --> 41:13.530
Check the garage.

41:13.880 --> 41:14.430
Yes.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.520
We can enjoy the crosstalk.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.730
Are you ready?

41:25.720 --> 41:26.870
Let's welcome

41:26.890 --> 41:28.820
this beautiful spring.

41:28.940 --> 41:31.680
Here we go. Countdown.

41:32.340 --> 41:35.220
Ten, nine, eight,

41:35.460 --> 41:38.340
seven, six, five...

41:50.760 --> 41:52.400
Captain Lu just came here and it's the Spring Festival.

41:53.570 --> 41:55.150
There are many duties for security check during the Festival.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.160
Every year

41:56.710 --> 41:57.410
is so busy.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.260
Isn't every year the same

42:01.480 --> 42:03.400
for SWAT police like us.

42:06.170 --> 42:07.170
It went quite well this year.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.300
One year before the Spring Festival,

42:11.870 --> 42:12.990
I caught up with a bomb disposal.

42:14.750 --> 42:15.720
My first love happened to be in

42:18.030 --> 42:18.460
Qining?

42:19.720 --> 42:20.360
Not Qining.

42:21.850 --> 42:22.480
In a city.

42:23.970 --> 42:25.010
I just became the Captain.

42:26.390 --> 42:27.320
For the sake of safety,

42:28.210 --> 42:28.860
I also borrowed

42:28.860 --> 42:30.320
SWAT police force from other stations.

42:32.160 --> 42:37.000
[2016]

42:35.870 --> 42:37.510
The New Year's party will start after the meeting.

42:38.010 --> 42:38.580
It looks like

42:38.580 --> 42:39.500
we're going to celebrate the New Year together.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.050
Yeah.

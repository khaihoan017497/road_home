[Episode 11]

01:38.890 --> 01:39.460
How could you date

01:39.460 --> 01:40.460
in other's billiards hall?

01:40.770 --> 01:41.520
You even broke the door.

01:42.490 --> 01:43.700
Your boss gave me the key.

01:46.140 --> 01:46.979
It's indeed the same.

01:47.210 --> 01:47.810
Who are you?

01:48.330 --> 01:48.750
Lu Chen.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.820
Are you the EOD expert of the Lu family?

01:53.070 --> 01:53.460
I'm a SWAT.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.539
I know.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.450
You usually dismantle the bombs.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.950
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

01:58.420 --> 01:59.060
Is something wrong?

01:59.660 --> 02:00.140
Your boss

02:00.140 --> 02:01.340
asked me to check

02:01.460 --> 02:02.360
the surveillance system here.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.170
He said there were blind spots

02:04.780 --> 02:05.820
and asked me to adjust

02:05.820 --> 02:06.580
the angle of the camera.

02:07.570 --> 02:08.479
Do you know that too?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.350
That's great. I'll take you there.

02:11.550 --> 02:12.140
Let's go right at the moment.

02:12.670 --> 02:13.710
There are indeed some blind spots.

02:13.740 --> 02:14.580
The immature young people

02:14.630 --> 02:15.760
always fight and bully people there.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.260
Let's go. I'll show you.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.090
Let's go. This way.

02:18.540 --> 02:18.880
Let's go.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.210
It's so convenient to ask a favour from an acquaintance.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.870
You even came to check in the middle of the night.

02:48.829 --> 02:49.550
Did you married couple

02:49.570 --> 02:50.630
come here after work?

02:51.820 --> 02:53.040
We're not married.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.410
We are alumni.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.300
When we were in school,

03:01.300 --> 03:02.330
we always played around here.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.940
So we dropped by here today.

03:15.080 --> 03:15.590
It's done.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.550
Please move this back to its original position.

03:18.579 --> 03:19.270
We're leaving first.

03:19.770 --> 03:20.530
Okay, thank you.

03:37.020 --> 03:37.430
Wait.

03:46.690 --> 03:47.800
It hasn't changed at all.

03:58.210 --> 03:59.060
You haven't changed at all too.

04:01.090 --> 04:01.670
What did you say?

04:03.850 --> 04:04.250
Nothing.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.900
I heard you say something.

04:07.460 --> 04:08.210
I said nothing.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.070
Where are we going now?

04:15.740 --> 04:16.390
The garage?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.560
I'll take you to Meng Xiaoshan's house.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.140
I'm afraid my dad is still in the garage.

04:20.610 --> 04:21.050
He'll make a scene.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.980
You can sleep well in Meng's house.

04:27.910 --> 04:31.050
Does your dad still hurt you?

04:33.250 --> 04:33.940
He doesn't dare to do it now.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.020
Next time when you come,

04:37.020 --> 04:38.020
I'll ask them in advance

04:39.060 --> 04:39.550
and try my best

04:40.380 --> 04:41.490
not to let you meet my family.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.580
You didn't say you were coming.

05:33.940 --> 05:34.540
Are you home?

05:40.050 --> 05:40.450
Look up.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.540
Do you want to go back to Qining

06:07.560 --> 06:08.180
with me?

06:09.220 --> 06:10.100
Are you going back?

06:11.360 --> 06:12.510
I have to help Xiaonan get his household registration permit.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.350
Let them send it over will do.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.010
This matter is complicated.

06:20.050 --> 06:20.720
I'll explain further to you tomorrow.

06:21.650 --> 06:22.150
Do you want to go?

06:25.930 --> 06:26.900
Do you really want to go back?

06:27.530 --> 06:28.510
From my perspective,

06:29.600 --> 06:30.730
Qining is my second hometown.

06:31.650 --> 06:32.420
Last time,

06:32.420 --> 06:33.140
we had a dispute.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.470
I didn't have the chance to show you around.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.940
This time, I want to take you

06:38.970 --> 06:40.650
to see the snowfield,

06:41.720 --> 06:43.290
sunset, forest,

06:44.920 --> 06:45.770
and people in the past.

06:50.990 --> 06:53.520
My working hours are flexible.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.240
As long as I have my phone and an Internet connection,

06:57.730 --> 06:58.460
I can leave anytime.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.110
I'll book a schedule.

07:03.860 --> 07:04.210
Okay.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.410
Have an early night.

08:13.060 --> 08:13.590
I'm really leaving.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.060
I just helped Qin Feng

08:22.060 --> 08:23.410
to fix the surveillance of his billiard hall.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.040
I remember

08:24.070 --> 08:25.100
the CCTV in my brother-in-law's school

08:25.100 --> 08:25.920
is also this brand.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.380
If there's any problem,

08:27.380 --> 08:28.020
he may come to me.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.080
Thank you.

08:29.580 --> 08:30.490
Why are you bother thanking me?

08:30.810 --> 08:31.860
I said it on behalf of your brother-in-law.

08:32.299 --> 08:33.500
Recently, he's always worried that

08:33.500 --> 08:35.030
if the CCTV has malfunctioned,

08:35.270 --> 08:36.950
the students facing danger in the blind spot will not be noticeable.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.120
Luckily, you're back.

08:38.150 --> 08:38.710
Otherwise,

08:38.740 --> 08:39.770
he can't sleep well again tonight.

08:40.900 --> 08:41.440
Pork rib soup.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.100
Take it back for the kid.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.179
Your friend asked us to take care of him.

08:44.179 --> 08:45.120
We can't starve him.

08:45.260 --> 08:46.530
Or else, we would disappoint his parents.

08:46.980 --> 08:48.260
Okay, go in quickly.

08:48.260 --> 08:48.580
Okay.

08:48.580 --> 08:49.300
My brother-in-law has been waiting for you.

08:49.880 --> 08:50.830
Drive slowly.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.410
Okay.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.720
Where's Aunt Gui Xiao?

09:08.180 --> 09:09.070
She's staying with her friend.

09:12.930 --> 09:13.380
What?

09:14.940 --> 09:16.340
I'm waiting for her.

09:29.180 --> 09:30.110
I need to go back to Qining.

09:30.820 --> 09:31.430
Is there anything

09:31.550 --> 09:32.620
you want me to bring to your dad?

09:33.700 --> 09:34.530
Or is there anything

09:34.700 --> 09:35.640
you want me to bring back for you?

09:37.780 --> 09:39.630
You have just progressed a little

09:40.790 --> 09:41.690
but now you're leaving?

09:44.990 --> 09:46.840
Why do you always worry about me?

09:48.260 --> 09:49.130
Mind your words.

09:49.820 --> 09:50.860
I'm worried that

09:51.840 --> 09:53.210
Aunt Gui Xiao is too outstanding.

09:53.580 --> 09:54.310
I'm afraid that when you return,

09:54.330 --> 09:55.700
you can't get her back anymore.

09:57.000 --> 09:57.930
She'll go back with me.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.700
No one is taking care of you lately.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.110
Be careful.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.620
Don't slack off on your homework.

10:12.430 --> 10:14.220
Make it clear before you leave.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.000
I'm going to take a shower.

10:15.830 --> 10:16.700
Have the pork rib soup.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.670
I'm worried that

10:31.750 --> 10:33.120
Aunt Gui Xiao is too outstanding.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.230
I'm afraid that when you return,

10:34.250 --> 10:35.610
you can't get her back anymore.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.580
Your dad always makes a scene when he is drunk.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.060
No one can deal with him.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.240
Don't go home tonight.

11:03.740 --> 11:04.360
Lu Chen.

11:04.740 --> 11:05.920
He's your dad.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.890
Don't take it to heart.

11:10.320 --> 11:10.740
It's okay.

11:12.180 --> 11:13.060
As long as he doesn't

11:13.060 --> 11:13.870
kick my sister out, I'll be fine.

11:28.410 --> 11:29.720
I'm going on a road trip.

11:29.830 --> 11:31.030
Sometimes the signal will be bad.

11:31.120 --> 11:31.940
If you need anything,

11:31.940 --> 11:32.730
just email me.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.060
When the signal gets better,

11:34.060 --> 11:34.980
I will give you a reply.

11:38.540 --> 11:39.580
Why is your first love

11:39.740 --> 11:40.970
going back to Qining all of a sudden?

11:42.660 --> 11:43.620
After he graduated from university,

11:43.620 --> 11:44.740
he was assigned to Qining.

11:45.260 --> 11:46.100
He has lived there

11:46.100 --> 11:47.160
for more than ten years.

11:47.550 --> 11:48.950
It's kind of his second hometown.

11:49.660 --> 11:50.670
Maybe he wants to go back and have a look.

11:52.630 --> 11:53.580
What about Qin Xiaonan?

11:54.020 --> 11:54.890
Who will take care of him after you leave?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.090
You met the person before. It's Hai Dong.

11:58.390 --> 11:59.270
It's him.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.220
He can't even

12:01.220 --> 12:02.220
tutor Xiaonan.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.440
We'll be back in two weeks.

12:06.370 --> 12:07.470
What about you leave it to me?

12:09.090 --> 12:09.700
You?

12:10.640 --> 12:12.030
He can stay at my place which is near to his school.

12:12.430 --> 12:13.620
I'll take care of the kid for two weeks.

12:17.540 --> 12:18.710
I'm being serious.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.220
Now I finally admit that

12:22.490 --> 12:23.650
you really like kids.

12:24.350 --> 12:25.100
Why would I lie to you?

12:25.620 --> 12:26.940
My aunt's kids

12:26.940 --> 12:28.380
like to play with me a lot on weekends.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.190
Leave it to me. It's a deal.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.460
Give me his dad's contact information.

12:33.460 --> 12:34.170
Just in case.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.140
If I can't find you,

12:35.280 --> 12:35.890
I'll go to his dad.

12:36.470 --> 12:38.420
Okay, I'll share his phone number with you.

12:41.180 --> 12:42.530
Qin Mingyu.

12:43.100 --> 12:43.790
He has a nice name.

12:46.100 --> 12:46.420
Tonight,

12:46.420 --> 12:47.580
ask the kid to pack up his things.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.860
I'll call a taxi and fetch him to my house.

12:49.560 --> 12:49.960
Thanks.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.350
Bye.

12:54.070 --> 12:54.920
Safe journey.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.930
Ms Meng.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.300
Is there any private room left?

13:00.670 --> 13:01.570
Yes, I'll find one for you.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.000
-Okay. I'll wait for you here.
-Noted.

13:05.100 --> 13:05.680
Gui Xiao.

13:06.740 --> 13:07.580
Are you going on a long journey again?

13:11.140 --> 13:11.920
Is Lu Chen here?

13:12.660 --> 13:13.150
Soon.

13:13.700 --> 13:14.500
Is Chen back too?

13:15.480 --> 13:15.910
Chen.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.670
I bought some fruit. We can eat them on the way.

13:27.060 --> 13:27.450
You're here.

13:31.450 --> 13:32.020
It's bumpy on the road.

13:32.610 --> 13:33.800
It'll be more convenient if you carry a bag instead of a suitcase.

13:35.780 --> 13:36.950
I have a bag here. You may use it.

13:37.940 --> 13:38.860
I'll change to the bag inside.

13:39.810 --> 13:40.540
I'll carry it for you.

13:57.570 --> 13:57.930
Gui Xiao.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.880
I still want to say something.

14:01.980 --> 14:03.410
Lu Chen was thoughtless.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.780
You two just made up not long ago.

14:05.780 --> 14:06.710
But now you are going on a trip together.

14:07.250 --> 14:08.360
If you get pregnant these days,

14:09.020 --> 14:10.610
it would be very troublesome.

14:14.230 --> 14:14.990
Did you buy a new car?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.240
No, second-hand.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.490
I've modified it after the repairs.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.180
Not bad.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.040
You modified a car worth one hundred  thousand yuan

14:23.070 --> 14:24.140
to be one that worth hundreds of thousands.

14:24.620 --> 14:25.170
Awesome.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.100
Think carefully.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.080
If you don't want to

14:30.110 --> 14:31.290
get married so early,

14:31.820 --> 14:33.400
you should take some protection measures.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.700
Don't get dizzy

14:34.700 --> 14:35.760
and have a child on the spur of the moment.

14:36.180 --> 14:36.890
By then,

14:36.910 --> 14:38.020
even if you feel you two are no more suitable

14:38.020 --> 14:38.540
after those years of separation,

14:38.860 --> 14:40.340
it would be very troublesome to break up.

14:47.850 --> 14:48.680
Fasten your seat belt.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.310
We're leaving.

14:50.900 --> 14:51.600
Drive safely.

15:00.260 --> 15:00.980
You said

15:00.980 --> 15:01.790
something you shouldn't have said, didn't you?

15:03.060 --> 15:04.260
I'm afraid Gui Xiao is muddleheaded.

15:09.730 --> 15:12.730
♫You must have secretly collected♫

15:12.750 --> 15:15.160
♫So much wind and frost♫

15:16.810 --> 15:20.030

15:20.120 --> 15:22.380

15:24.710 --> 15:29.440

15:31.850 --> 15:34.260
♫Half a moon♫

15:35.520 --> 15:37.310
♫The moon♫

15:39.740 --> 15:42.610
♫You must have wiped it silently♫

15:42.500 --> 15:43.130
Let's take a break.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.920
♫For a long time♫

15:44.380 --> 15:45.530
The next service area is quite far.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.390
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

15:49.420 --> 15:52.260
♫Only have the light when it's like a mystery♫

15:54.650 --> 15:59.590
♫On a night when no one knows♫

16:01.870 --> 16:04.230
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

16:05.340 --> 16:07.390
♫The breeze♫

16:09.750 --> 16:12.990
♫You must have been there in secret♫

16:12.990 --> 16:15.560
♫To the farthest places♫

16:16.730 --> 16:19.760
♫Bringing back the green plants of summer♫

16:20.090 --> 16:24.000
♫And the fallen leaves of autumn♫

16:22.600 --> 16:23.170
Hot coffee.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.340
The food inside

16:24.690 --> 16:30.080
♫On a night when you're dating in the garden♫

16:25.340 --> 16:25.980
didn't seem to be delicious.

16:25.980 --> 16:26.590
So I didn't buy any.

16:28.850 --> 16:30.220
Don't we have GPS?

16:31.260 --> 16:32.280
I'm used to looking at the map.

16:31.580 --> 16:37.340
♫The pathos of youth is sung♫

16:34.960 --> 16:35.910
I came here once last year.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.770
The scenery I can see along the way,

16:40.170 --> 16:42.050
the location where the blacktop of the road was faded,

16:42.640 --> 16:44.090
and the axle smashed by a truck,

16:44.820 --> 16:46.170
I still remember them.

16:48.310 --> 16:50.170
There are some things that can't be navigated through GPS.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.040
Here.

17:07.550 --> 17:08.460
I just remembered something.

17:09.140 --> 17:10.180
Do you remember the man

17:10.180 --> 17:11.240
we saw at the airport?

17:11.579 --> 17:12.400
His name is Xu Yao.

17:14.980 --> 17:15.990
Don't you like meat floss?

17:18.300 --> 17:19.380
You like meat floss.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.460
And I'm not picky. So I'll just eat this.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.339
You're very observant.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.600
His wife is seriously ill.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.260
The local hospital confirmed that

17:33.260 --> 17:35.800
she had to be operated on her spine.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.600
It seems to be the back of the neck.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.540
But after the surgery,

17:42.590 --> 17:43.500
she will face dreadful sequela.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.080
They dare not do it easily.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.840
So they want to go overseas for another check-up.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.580
If there is a certain possibility

17:49.780 --> 17:51.300
to diagnosing

17:51.300 --> 17:52.570
another kind of tumour,

17:52.790 --> 17:53.790
she doesn't need surgery,

17:53.900 --> 17:54.770
but radiotherapy.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.790
His wife has been sick for many years.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.090
He doesn't have much savings left.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.040
So he came to me.

17:59.460 --> 18:00.680
I saved some for myself.

18:00.900 --> 18:01.860
It's enough for the living expenses

18:01.860 --> 18:02.610
of Qin Xiaonan and me.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.570
I gave him the rest.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.430
You're still in debt.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.450
Just leave Qin Xiaonan to me.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.240
He doesn't spend much anyway.

18:16.460 --> 18:16.800
No need.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.280
Qin Mingyu always pays his living expenses to me.

18:34.660 --> 18:35.660
Xu Yao and his wife

18:35.660 --> 18:36.660
have known each other since childhood.

18:37.460 --> 18:38.740
They've been tangled for many years.

18:40.630 --> 18:43.310
Probably the year before last.

18:43.610 --> 18:44.650
His wife got sick.

18:45.340 --> 18:46.660
And they keep visiting the doctor since then.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.020
At that moment, they haven't gotten married yet.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.050
His wife disagreed to get a marriage certificate.

18:51.180 --> 18:51.970
She didn't want to weigh him down.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.420
But Xu Yao

18:53.540 --> 18:54.850
held a wedding ceremony for her

18:55.500 --> 18:56.760
and insisted on marrying her.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.250
Life is so unpredictable.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.800
The previous year, you were still happy with the achievements

19:04.010 --> 19:06.190
but fell into the mud pit the next year.

19:08.460 --> 19:10.660
It couldn't be when Xu Yao's wife was sick,

19:10.700 --> 19:12.020
he just abandoned her.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.660
And those who have been married.

19:15.080 --> 19:15.520
After getting married,

19:15.550 --> 19:17.110
if anyone has a career crisis,

19:18.290 --> 19:19.850
they would overcome it together.

19:22.060 --> 19:22.900
Everyone faces ups and downs

19:22.900 --> 19:24.340
in their lives.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.380
You can't hope for your lover

19:26.820 --> 19:28.200
to support you selflessly

19:29.010 --> 19:30.410
when you are facing difficulty,

19:30.900 --> 19:33.060
but then

19:33.060 --> 19:33.780
you yourself find a better person

19:33.780 --> 19:34.860
when you have achieved a great success.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.690
This is not reality.

19:38.910 --> 19:39.690
It's imagination.

19:45.970 --> 19:47.090
Meng Xiaoshan cares about me.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.970
Don't mind what she said.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.190
Meng Xiaoshan

19:53.660 --> 19:54.460
doesn't have a clear understanding about

19:54.460 --> 19:55.220
my situation.

19:56.800 --> 19:57.450
At most, only two years.

19:58.540 --> 19:59.250
I will settle my debt.

20:05.770 --> 20:06.660
Then I'll save money to marry you.

20:21.490 --> 20:22.170
You wish!

20:24.860 --> 20:25.400
Are you not willing to marry me?

20:28.270 --> 20:28.760
If you agree,

20:30.070 --> 20:31.210
we'll sleep in the same room tonight.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.130
If you don't agree, we'll sleep separately.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.110
The room we booked yesterday

20:40.580 --> 20:41.590
has a double bed.

21:04.890 --> 21:11.150
[Jimu Cliff]

21:14.030 --> 21:14.420
Captain Lu.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.430
How have you been these two years?

21:19.940 --> 21:20.400
Good.

21:22.120 --> 21:22.740
This is...

21:24.130 --> 21:25.940
Gui Xiao, my girlfriend.

21:26.860 --> 21:27.250
Hello.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.390
Hello, I'm Sun Hao.

21:31.370 --> 21:31.750
Captain Lu.

21:32.200 --> 21:32.940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

21:33.490 --> 21:34.020
If you told me earlier,

21:34.020 --> 21:34.620
I would have arranged for a deluxe couple package

21:34.620 --> 21:35.290
for you.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.040
Do you still have this kind of service?

21:38.700 --> 21:39.470
It's for vacation.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.700
Of course we have suites for couples.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.900
Why are you taking me here?

21:45.900 --> 21:46.980
It's cold.

21:46.980 --> 21:47.660
Hang in there.

21:47.660 --> 21:48.800
The sunrise will be beautiful tomorrow morning.

21:48.860 --> 21:49.290
Trust me.

21:54.270 --> 21:55.000
Let me do it.

21:56.830 --> 21:58.040
You came at the right time.

21:58.620 --> 21:59.540
Winter is not the peak season.

21:59.980 --> 22:00.710
There are fewer people staying here.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.130
Look,

22:02.660 --> 22:03.140
during the summer,

22:03.140 --> 22:04.460
it is an endless prairie.

22:04.580 --> 22:05.060
We simply followed

22:05.060 --> 22:05.900
the design of a Mongolian yurt

22:05.960 --> 22:06.820
and built a resort.

22:12.950 --> 22:13.510
Thank you.

22:16.610 --> 22:16.930
Xiao,

22:17.660 --> 22:18.420
Actually, I'm not

22:18.420 --> 22:19.160
in Captain Lu's team.

22:20.030 --> 22:20.690
I'm not qualified.

22:21.220 --> 22:21.970
They are

22:22.100 --> 22:23.250
all elites.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.500
But Captain Lu taught us how to dismantle bombs.

22:25.820 --> 22:26.380
He's my master.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.460
Do you know how I felt

22:28.460 --> 22:29.060
when I first met Captain Lu?

22:30.090 --> 22:31.390
He's so arrogant.

22:31.870 --> 22:32.550
The first time I saw him

22:33.130 --> 22:33.830
standing there,

22:34.070 --> 22:34.770
the first sentence he said was,

22:35.540 --> 22:36.980
"It's not easy to be a SWAT."

22:37.980 --> 22:38.910
He scared us on the first day

22:39.250 --> 22:41.260
saying that there is no absolute expert in dismantling bombs.

22:41.540 --> 22:43.400
Everyone is just risking their lives.

22:44.700 --> 22:45.110
Well,

22:45.600 --> 22:46.580
the EOD expert,

22:46.580 --> 22:47.790
who had a communication with him last year,

22:48.200 --> 22:49.210
was just killed in the war zone.

22:50.780 --> 22:51.990
When I first learned it,

22:52.200 --> 22:53.160
I was very careful.

22:53.470 --> 22:54.370
I thought I was successful.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.420
So I cut it off.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.730
And then he came.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.580
Do you know what Captain Lu said?

23:00.190 --> 23:00.620
What?

23:01.050 --> 23:01.930
He said I was already blown to death.

23:05.590 --> 23:06.540
Before Captain Lu left...

23:06.580 --> 23:06.970
Alright.

23:07.870 --> 23:08.510
Let's not talk about the past.

23:09.570 --> 23:10.650
How can I not?

23:10.700 --> 23:12.050
That was all your heroic deeds.

23:12.210 --> 23:12.600
Xiao.

23:12.950 --> 23:13.400
When Captain Lu

23:14.020 --> 23:14.940
covered for others,

23:14.940 --> 23:15.380
he was shot.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.390
You should have seen the scar.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.030
Captain Lu.

23:46.570 --> 23:47.800
The third one from this side.

23:48.340 --> 23:49.290
I have to help my mom with the account.

23:50.140 --> 23:50.660
Captain Lu.

23:51.070 --> 23:51.710
The horses are all here.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.170
Pick one if you want.

23:54.530 --> 23:55.300
I'll go back first.

24:12.620 --> 24:13.460
It's all dark.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.420
They slept so early.

24:15.780 --> 24:16.390
It's late.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.150
It's already eleven.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.440
How many beds are in there?

25:03.750 --> 25:08.480
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

25:10.660 --> 25:15.380
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

25:17.360 --> 25:22.440
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

25:23.310 --> 25:27.580
♫It becomes the truth of my empty dream♫

25:30.750 --> 25:35.960
♫Love is the gentle looks of a youth♫

25:37.600 --> 25:42.650
♫Be bolder, come closer♫

25:44.380 --> 25:49.530
♫You are the curtain call speech for my youth♫

25:50.350 --> 25:54.960
♫You are everything on my tiny planet♫

25:57.120 --> 25:59.640
♫I've thought about it once in a while♫

25:59.260 --> 25:59.820
May I?

25:59.640 --> 26:02.170
♫The wind blows towards the snowfield♫

26:03.820 --> 26:09.420
♫Your light will drive away all the cold nights♫

26:05.630 --> 26:06.590
You kissed me that time

26:07.270 --> 26:07.990
without asking.

26:11.380 --> 26:12.990
♫I'm willing to♫

26:13.120 --> 26:16.390
♫Hold all my thoughts♫

26:16.860 --> 26:22.780
♫All dreams are coming for you♫

26:26.820 --> 26:27.740
It was normal when I was injured.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.190
Aren't you an EOD technician?

26:32.440 --> 26:33.630
EOD is my major.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.370
The duty of SWAT

26:36.740 --> 26:38.070
is to maintain the stability of our country.

26:39.170 --> 26:40.110
Whether it's a gunfight, knife battle,

26:40.530 --> 26:41.770
or bomb, I've encountered it all.

26:43.330 --> 26:44.940
You didn't mention it before.

26:47.780 --> 26:48.810
What's there to say?

26:50.680 --> 26:51.780
On the first day I went in,

26:52.500 --> 26:53.650
the old captain told me

26:54.920 --> 26:55.590
there were things

26:56.850 --> 26:57.900
you shouldn't tell your family

26:58.660 --> 26:59.490
and you'd better not.

27:00.780 --> 27:01.700
It has no benefits

27:03.690 --> 27:04.310
except to worry them.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.050
All these years in the SWAT,

27:15.310 --> 27:16.540
none of us was uninjured.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.220
Last year,

27:19.220 --> 27:20.080
a new kid

27:20.620 --> 27:22.170
hurt his leg during training.

27:22.920 --> 27:23.770
He was quite happy.

27:25.260 --> 27:25.750
He said,

27:26.780 --> 27:27.590
finally, he was injured

27:28.550 --> 27:29.630
and dared to say

27:30.090 --> 27:31.470
that he belonged to the squadron.

27:55.550 --> 27:56.840
You insisted on going.

27:59.190 --> 28:00.590
You didn't listen to any of my advice.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.260
Now you've suffered so much.

28:10.660 --> 28:11.700
This is crazy.

28:12.210 --> 28:14.130
Why do you have to come to the prairie in winter?

28:14.660 --> 28:16.030
People usually come in summer.

28:16.070 --> 28:16.630
It's freezing all night.

28:16.650 --> 28:17.610
I am frozen to death.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.270
The craziest thing is

28:19.540 --> 28:20.540
watching the sunrise.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.060
Sunrise my ass.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.290
I'm going to sleep with Sun Hao.

29:03.150 --> 29:04.070
Calm down.

29:05.230 --> 29:06.220
We've been frozen all night.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.260
Why are you still watching the sunrise?

29:07.280 --> 29:07.830
Okay, go on.

29:09.740 --> 29:10.580
All right.

29:10.970 --> 29:11.520
It's all your fault.

29:20.570 --> 29:21.410
Did you just quarrel with your girlfriend?

29:24.240 --> 29:24.940
Besides this,

29:25.450 --> 29:26.520
I can't think of anything else.

29:27.250 --> 29:27.700
Your girlfriend is still

29:27.700 --> 29:28.690
lying on her warm bed.

29:29.140 --> 29:29.880
What can you do coming out

29:29.970 --> 29:30.840
in the middle of the night?

29:46.640 --> 29:47.980
Go that way. It's spacious.

29:51.830 --> 29:52.590
Wait for me.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.280
Last time when we came here,

30:11.140 --> 30:11.820
his wife was still here.

30:13.290 --> 30:14.330
Now, she's gone.

30:14.590 --> 30:15.630
He's left alone.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.040
Let me knock on the door.

30:19.820 --> 30:20.670
He has said it many times.

30:21.100 --> 30:21.740
When you return,

30:21.880 --> 30:22.900
he wants to have a drink with you.

30:24.920 --> 30:25.370
It's too late.

30:27.670 --> 30:28.680
The light is still on.

30:29.780 --> 30:30.570
The guest-welcoming light is on

30:31.330 --> 30:32.240
means that the host hasn't slept yet.

30:41.030 --> 30:41.510
Who is it?

30:44.660 --> 30:45.140
Good evening.

30:47.860 --> 30:48.840
Why are you here today?

30:55.780 --> 30:56.310
Captain Lu.

31:00.630 --> 31:01.940
Come on.

31:02.180 --> 31:02.940
Here, take it.

31:03.720 --> 31:04.500
Here, take it.

31:05.180 --> 31:05.850
Sit down.

31:08.540 --> 31:09.630
I made it myself.

31:10.790 --> 31:12.320
Have a taste.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.490
Come on.

31:20.490 --> 31:21.160
Drink.

31:21.250 --> 31:21.580
Drink.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.050
The last time we met was...

31:31.820 --> 31:32.360
Two years ago.

31:33.100 --> 31:33.970
Yes.

31:35.070 --> 31:36.230
Is Captain Lu still in Qining?

31:38.260 --> 31:38.900
I went back to my hometown.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.420
Back to hometown?

31:43.260 --> 31:44.020
Okay.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.530
You've reached the age.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.440
It's good to be with your parents.

31:51.060 --> 31:51.330
Here.

31:53.530 --> 31:53.940
Let's eat.

31:58.860 --> 32:00.220
You're drinking too fast.

32:01.850 --> 32:02.160
Here.

32:21.050 --> 32:21.500
Captain Lu.

32:22.880 --> 32:23.200
Here.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.690
I wish you leave a few days later.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.300
My youngest son is coming back.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.010
Next time.

32:33.940 --> 32:34.980
When he goes to Beijing next time,

32:35.310 --> 32:35.970
ask him to come to me.

32:36.380 --> 32:36.900
Okay.

32:44.940 --> 32:46.140
Actually, when I heard about

32:46.140 --> 32:47.290
your family situation at first,

32:47.650 --> 32:48.400
I was quite shocked.

32:49.750 --> 32:50.820
What for?

32:51.570 --> 32:53.650
There are over 20 police officers in a family.

32:56.380 --> 32:57.500
It is heroic to say,

32:58.230 --> 32:59.260
but difficult to do.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.440
Outsiders don't understand.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.230
We, as your peers, know that

33:05.500 --> 33:06.880
the family glory

33:08.690 --> 33:10.000
is paid for with blood and tears.

33:12.460 --> 33:14.030
Family glory.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.380
Family glory.

33:18.950 --> 33:19.550
Captain Lu.

33:21.050 --> 33:21.790
Thank you.

33:39.770 --> 33:40.360
My stepfather

33:42.010 --> 33:43.270
was also a person who defended the country.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.650
He married my mother for only a few years

33:47.020 --> 33:47.920
and died of illness after that.

33:50.540 --> 33:51.330
I had his influence

33:52.810 --> 33:53.620
in getting into this career.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.940
I had no goal when I was studying.

33:59.860 --> 34:00.930
I came here after graduation.

34:01.830 --> 34:03.100
In the frontline of the police force,

34:04.020 --> 34:04.500
I have arrested

34:04.500 --> 34:05.870
the most vicious fugitives

34:06.950 --> 34:07.980
and dismantled thousands of

34:08.060 --> 34:09.739
bombs, professional or non-professional.

34:11.139 --> 34:11.900
I think

34:13.710 --> 34:14.960
this is the best way to live.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.860
That's why I envy you.

34:22.949 --> 34:24.020
With the guidance of your parents,

34:24.300 --> 34:25.380
you've avoided many detours.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.070
Is something bothering you today?

34:43.420 --> 34:45.760
People always have something on their minds.

34:47.100 --> 34:47.780
Sometimes more,

34:48.860 --> 34:49.600
sometimes less.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.690
Have you visited your former captain?

35:05.340 --> 35:05.810
The day after tomorrow.

35:06.810 --> 35:07.610
I'll go on my way back.

35:09.620 --> 35:11.220
Also, I'll visit some old friends.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.520
Have some warm milk tea to warm up your body.

36:12.940 --> 36:13.740
Not bad, right?

36:47.670 --> 36:48.990
What were you talking about with Mama Sun?

36:52.210 --> 36:53.830
She said the couple yesterday

36:54.310 --> 36:55.170
was frozen

36:55.890 --> 36:56.760
and had a big fight.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.450
They didn't even see the sunrise this morning.

37:00.350 --> 37:01.340
They just went straight to the city.

37:04.370 --> 37:05.040
It's really cold.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.860
And the more I sleep, the colder I get.

37:08.910 --> 37:10.110
I just woke up from the cold

37:10.320 --> 37:11.110
and I found you...

37:31.230 --> 37:35.960
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

37:36.900 --> 37:37.970
Do you know what this is called?

37:38.140 --> 37:42.850
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

37:39.410 --> 37:39.810
What?

37:43.580 --> 37:44.220
The sunlight in the morning (Chen Xiao in Pinyin).

37:44.840 --> 37:49.920
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

37:50.790 --> 37:55.050
It becomes the truth of my empty dream♫

37:58.230 --> 38:03.430
♫Love is the gentle looks of a youth♫

38:05.080 --> 38:10.130
♫Be bolder, come closer♫

38:11.850 --> 38:17.010
♫You are the curtain call speech for my youth♫

38:12.940 --> 38:14.430
Don't you think we're destined to be together?

38:15.770 --> 38:16.660
How can you tell?

38:17.470 --> 38:18.030
Look.

38:17.830 --> 38:22.440
You are everything on my tiny planet♫

38:18.500 --> 38:19.180
The last word

38:19.180 --> 38:20.620
of your name is Chen.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.440
Mine is Xiao.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.040
Chen Xiao.

38:23.750 --> 38:24.860
It means the sunlight in the morning.

38:24.890 --> 38:26.500
♫I'm willing to♫

38:26.220 --> 38:26.890
Isn't it perfect?

38:26.640 --> 38:29.900
♫Hold all my thoughts♫

38:30.850 --> 38:36.880
♫All dreams are coming for you♫

38:37.440 --> 38:39.780
♫Because it's you♫

38:40.060 --> 38:43.580
♫It's almighty you♫

38:44.080 --> 38:47.090
♫I've travelled through time♫

38:47.120 --> 38:50.620
♫Only for a reunion with you♫

38:50.970 --> 38:53.030
♫Because it's you♫

38:53.510 --> 38:57.940
♫You're always at the end of my dream♫

38:58.420 --> 39:01.290
♫Maybe in my life♫

39:01.580 --> 39:02.590
Have some milk tea.

39:01.930 --> 39:07.450
♫I've been waiting for dawn to meet you♫

39:03.060 --> 39:03.800
Thank you.

39:04.940 --> 39:06.530
After that couple left,

39:06.810 --> 39:08.460
you are indeed

39:07.830 --> 39:11.740
♫You're my only desire♫

39:08.490 --> 39:09.620
the only privileged guests.

39:11.990 --> 39:12.580
You guys talk.

39:12.910 --> 39:20.410
♫I just want to hold you tight♫

39:22.760 --> 39:23.520
Come in.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.750
This is a senior apartment.

39:26.780 --> 39:28.630
We have the most convenient transportation.

39:28.940 --> 39:29.980
And the location is good

39:29.980 --> 39:31.170
in the second ring.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.030
Friendship Hospital

39:33.060 --> 39:34.140
is right in front of us.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.440
There are gym and entertainment rooms.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.360
It's totally a hotel apartment.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.420
The rooms are in a suite...

39:40.060 --> 39:40.400
Yes.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.830
My boss is calling. Sorry.

39:47.850 --> 39:49.180
Go ahead. I'll look around by myself.

39:49.240 --> 39:49.610
Okay.

39:49.630 --> 39:50.030
Okay.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.150
How is this apartment?

39:57.890 --> 39:58.490
It's pretty good.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.970
We viewed five apartments this morning.

40:03.410 --> 40:04.180
Give a comment.

40:05.200 --> 40:05.800
Me?

40:07.340 --> 40:08.020
I want to know

40:08.020 --> 40:09.790
your view as a kid.

40:13.710 --> 40:14.970
Good.

40:16.780 --> 40:17.340
That's all?

40:19.890 --> 40:20.810
You lack words in the expression.

40:20.850 --> 40:21.810
I'll get you more language classes after this.

40:25.850 --> 40:26.510
Aunt Duan Rou.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.490
Why are we viewing

40:29.510 --> 40:30.430
the senior apartment?

40:33.560 --> 40:35.250
It's a long story.

40:38.460 --> 40:39.430
How about I treat you to a nice meal?

40:40.370 --> 40:40.700
Let's go.

40:54.380 --> 40:55.660
I'm also from a single-parent family.

40:55.990 --> 40:56.680
Just like you.

40:58.580 --> 40:59.660
My mum

41:00.090 --> 41:01.300
is not in good health recently.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.140
But I often go on business trips

41:03.140 --> 41:04.160
and don't have time to take care of her.

41:05.270 --> 41:06.420
So I am thinking of

41:06.450 --> 41:07.580
arranging for a senior apartment for her.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.020
There are doctors

41:09.020 --> 41:09.830
and others taking care of her.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.750
There are also new friends to play with her.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.690
After finding a few,

41:15.290 --> 41:16.160
I suddenly became interested

41:16.180 --> 41:16.680
in this industry,

41:17.210 --> 41:18.050
and started investing.

41:20.850 --> 41:22.950
Didn't your father look for you?

41:24.420 --> 41:25.060
He's busy.

41:26.780 --> 41:27.780
After Uncle Lu left,

41:28.380 --> 41:28.930
he will be

41:28.960 --> 41:30.280
the captain of the SWAT brigade.

41:32.220 --> 41:32.670
Is it delicious?

41:33.190 --> 41:33.630
Yes.

41:33.820 --> 41:34.360
One more?

41:34.750 --> 41:35.220
One more.

41:42.020 --> 41:42.400
Come on.

41:42.620 --> 41:43.410
Thank you.

41:44.340 --> 41:45.060
Here, eat.

41:45.660 --> 41:46.390
Make yourself at home.

41:49.150 --> 41:49.940
Have another bun.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.010
Thank you.

41:53.060 --> 41:53.900
The people here

41:53.950 --> 41:55.160
are really enthusiastic.

41:55.910 --> 41:57.230
Last time when I came with Cai Yaya,

41:57.390 --> 41:58.590
we met a family on the way

41:58.610 --> 41:59.850
that we didn't even know.

42:00.380 --> 42:01.580
We just wanted to ask for directions,

42:01.780 --> 42:02.860
but they pulled us into their house

42:02.860 --> 42:03.840
and gave us a bowl of milk tea

42:03.860 --> 42:04.820
and some beef jerky.

42:05.140 --> 42:06.390
We were both dumbfounded.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.720
Change the channel to CCTV and watch the news.

42:21.900 --> 42:22.660
I have a call.

42:23.580 --> 42:24.460
I need to answer a call.

42:31.610 --> 42:32.800
Hello, who is this?

42:33.850 --> 42:34.770
I'm Gui Yuanshan,

42:35.180 --> 42:36.130
the father of Gui Xiao.

42:36.970 --> 42:38.050
You remember me, right?

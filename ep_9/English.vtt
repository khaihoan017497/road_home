14:39.900 --> 14:41.290
She seemed a little unhappy.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.450
I was afraid I might say something wrong,

so I came out for a while.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.790
Did she bully you?

No.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.340
Your mother is nice.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.540
She even asked Qin Xiaonan and me

14:53.900 --> 14:54.820
to go eat at your house.

14:56.940 --> 14:58.190
Are we going?

15:00.060 --> 15:00.650
Do you want to go?

15:05.840 --> 15:06.810
I bought so many things.

15:07.060 --> 15:07.750
It's a waste if we don't eat them.

15:08.290 --> 15:08.640
Go on in.

15:10.430 --> 15:11.650
If I don't go,

15:11.850 --> 15:13.080
shouldn't we explain it to her?

15:13.750 --> 15:14.420

15:45.970 --> 15:47.250
Isn't there a small one too?

15:47.670 --> 15:48.600
Uncle Lu said

15:48.900 --> 15:49.950
he was scared you might want to eat a big fish

15:50.040 --> 15:50.560
and we didn't have one.

Okay. You go in first.

16:11.910 --> 16:13.100
I'll get you some water.

Okay, thank you.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.020
Thank you.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.160
You're welcome.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.740
I'm happy that you came to chat with me.

16:22.770 --> 16:23.490
Come here more often.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.640
She will come often.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.230
I'll get going then.

16:27.280 --> 16:27.760
Go ahead.

16:29.930 --> 16:30.300
Wash your hands.

16:41.820 --> 16:42.730
Sister-in-law?

16:43.020 --> 16:43.560
Hai Dong?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.070
We've finally met.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.740
Meng Xiaoshan told me about you.

16:46.740 --> 16:47.540
Lu Chen told me about you.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.740
But I didn't get to see you.

16:48.900 --> 16:49.650
When did you get here?

16:49.910 --> 16:50.400
In the morning,

16:50.430 --> 16:50.940
around ten o’clock.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.260
Lu Chen didn't tell me. He's hiding you from me.

16:53.360 --> 16:53.980
If he'd told me,

16:53.980 --> 16:55.020
I'd have come immediately.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.380
Wait a minute.

16:57.530 --> 16:58.650
There are some punks outside

16:58.670 --> 16:59.230
causing trouble.

16:59.260 --> 16:59.900
I'll go take a look.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.350
I'll get rid of the water for you.

17:01.820 --> 17:02.180
Okay.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.210
Take this away too.

17:03.240 --> 17:03.550
Okay.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.260
You're not leaving tonight, right?

17:11.260 --> 17:11.819
Stay for dinner.

17:12.230 --> 17:12.680
I'm staying.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.890
I'll sleep at Meng Xiaoshan's place tonight.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.109
That's good.

17:22.819 --> 17:24.300
The fish jumped out just now.

17:24.319 --> 17:24.880
Qin Xiaonan and I got dirty

17:24.910 --> 17:26.390
when we put it back in.

17:28.220 --> 17:28.460
Let's go.

17:28.960 --> 17:29.520
Let's go cook.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.340
Is everything okay at the garage?

17:35.000 --> 17:35.420
It's nothing.

17:36.020 --> 17:36.770
Who do you think I am?

17:37.280 --> 17:38.430
I got nervous and forgot.

17:45.940 --> 17:46.250
Go

17:46.750 --> 17:47.410
and do your workbook.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.180
If we don't go,

18:09.180 --> 18:09.900
shouldn't we tell your mother

18:09.900 --> 18:10.980
in person?

18:11.900 --> 18:12.260
There's no need.

18:12.940 --> 18:13.700
I'll tell her myself.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.040
How do you want to eat it?

18:16.950 --> 18:17.790
What kind of fish is this?

18:18.340 --> 18:18.700
Mandarin fish.

18:21.380 --> 18:22.620
It's expensive.

18:24.660 --> 18:25.650
How expensive can a fish be?

18:27.700 --> 18:28.200
How do you want it?

18:30.870 --> 18:31.590
I want squirrel fish.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.070
You're still as picky as when you were young.

18:35.770 --> 18:36.490
Don't you think it's troublesome?

18:40.260 --> 18:40.730
Hai Dong.

18:41.090 --> 18:41.830
Let's eat together when you're free.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.520
Hai Dong.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.080
Business has been booming lately.

18:45.340 --> 18:46.220
Don't forget about us.

18:46.550 --> 18:47.440
Go away.

18:47.580 --> 18:48.230
Hurry up.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.270
Don't do anything stupid again.

18:50.820 --> 18:51.290
Hai Dong.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.100
Buy a packet of cornstarch for me!

18:54.470 --> 18:55.070
Okay.

19:05.170 --> 19:11.300
[Fortune Garden]

19:18.850 --> 19:20.210
What are you doing in front of my hotel?

19:20.310 --> 19:20.880
You want to borrow money?

19:21.860 --> 19:23.490
No, I'm buying cornstarch.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.130
Who can make you run errands for them?

19:26.500 --> 19:28.020
Chen. Who else could it be?

19:28.950 --> 19:29.670
He's cooking?

19:30.530 --> 19:31.100
Who is he hosting?

19:31.600 --> 19:32.600
Your sister, Gui Xiao.

19:34.950 --> 19:35.980
She's back?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.040
Tell her that

19:38.070 --> 19:38.990
I'll keep the door open for her tonight

19:39.010 --> 19:39.680
at my parents' place.

19:40.660 --> 19:40.990
Okay.

19:41.220 --> 19:42.020
I'll go in first.

19:42.050 --> 19:42.700
I'm so busy.

20:04.450 --> 20:04.780
Here.

20:05.890 --> 20:06.620
Check if it's too salty.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.020
It's not.

20:20.530 --> 20:21.210
It's really fresh.

20:32.980 --> 20:33.780
Come on.

20:57.580 --> 20:58.430
How did you do it?

20:58.570 --> 20:59.610
It opened just like that?

21:00.520 --> 21:00.950
Take it easy.

21:01.420 --> 21:02.020
Don't hurt yourself.

21:08.060 --> 21:08.750
I have a cousin

21:08.780 --> 21:09.830
who's in a SWAT team.

21:09.930 --> 21:10.610
She even trained to smash bricks

21:10.630 --> 21:11.440
with her bare hands.

21:11.890 --> 21:13.130
Do you know how to do it?

21:14.900 --> 21:15.380
I've never trained for it.

21:15.940 --> 21:16.720
I'm not good at that.

21:18.160 --> 21:18.810
But I once

21:18.840 --> 21:19.680
mentored a team member

21:19.700 --> 21:20.390
who liked to do it.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.250
He had a stack of them lined up.

21:23.220 --> 21:23.860
I think he must have smashed

21:23.860 --> 21:25.020
dozens of them in a row.

21:29.470 --> 21:30.110
That's great.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.160
Great.

21:33.620 --> 21:34.300
We were waiting for you.

21:34.900 --> 21:35.990
I've bought the stuff.

21:36.140 --> 21:36.890
I've also prepared

21:36.910 --> 21:37.810
alcohol and my sentimentality.

21:37.900 --> 21:38.680
We're just waiting for your dish.

21:38.710 --> 21:39.420
Let me have a good cry.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.000
I'll go cook.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.730
I saw his mother just now.

21:59.730 --> 22:00.910
Lu Chen’s mom came?

22:01.390 --> 22:02.940
It was most likely that aunt-in-law

22:02.970 --> 22:04.130
from the finance office who asked her to come.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.710
My mom told me that

22:06.370 --> 22:07.690
when Lu Chen was three,

22:08.490 --> 22:10.360
he was punished and scolded by his dad

22:10.660 --> 22:11.480
during Chinese New Year.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.230
It was just because Lu Chen

22:12.270 --> 22:13.130
had said something wrong.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.140
He stood beside the dining table

22:15.170 --> 22:16.050
for a whole night.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.230
Lu Chen’s mother wanted to see Lu Chen,

22:18.300 --> 22:19.520
but his aunt-in-law didn't let her.

22:20.690 --> 22:21.700
Lu Chen's father

22:21.700 --> 22:22.990
favored sons over daughters.

22:23.660 --> 22:25.310
He used to hit his sister whenever he got drunk.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.070
In the end,

22:26.230 --> 22:27.720
Lu Chen would deliberately provoke his father.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.060
He saved his sister many times.

22:30.490 --> 22:32.210
Now, he's finally grown up.

22:32.870 --> 22:33.410
It wasn't easy.

22:38.060 --> 22:38.510
By the way,

22:39.050 --> 22:40.720
are you two ready to make up?

22:42.660 --> 22:43.260
No.

22:44.180 --> 22:44.900
We're just friends.

22:47.340 --> 22:47.940
Just friends?

23:07.150 --> 23:08.660
Take care.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.830
I'll be happy

23:11.330 --> 23:12.130
if you two are happy.

23:28.760 --> 23:29.700
I've brought him back for you.

23:30.270 --> 23:31.070
Make him drink more water.

23:31.690 --> 23:32.460
Keep an eye on him tonight.

23:32.660 --> 23:33.190
Don't worry.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.410
Sister-in-law.

23:35.170 --> 23:35.870
Get in.

23:35.950 --> 23:36.900
Let's meet another day.

23:38.500 --> 23:38.940
Gui Xiao?

23:40.330 --> 23:41.050
I'm Hai Jianfeng.

23:41.070 --> 23:41.850
Do you remember me?

23:42.660 --> 23:43.220
Of course.

23:44.050 --> 23:44.980
Wait.

23:45.010 --> 23:46.180
I was in Dalian a couple of days ago,

23:46.300 --> 23:47.620
when they talked about having a class reunion.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.020
I thought it was a pity that I couldn't see you.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.100
You...

23:51.140 --> 23:51.780
Hai Jianfeng.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.640
You're not allowed to have designs on Gui Xiao anymore.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.200
She's Chen's wife now.

23:57.590 --> 23:59.140
What are you talking about?

23:59.380 --> 24:00.300
I was just excited

24:00.300 --> 24:01.060
to see an old classmate.

24:01.140 --> 24:01.690
Come on.

24:02.080 --> 24:02.810
Let me tell you.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.150
This brother of mine

24:05.120 --> 24:07.200
fell in love with your wife

24:07.230 --> 24:08.380
on the first day of secondary school.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.380
You wouldn't even believe it.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.910
Even now, he still has

24:11.940 --> 24:12.900
a photo of Gui Xiao

24:12.920 --> 24:13.820
by his bedside.

24:14.010 --> 24:15.820
It's been there since graduation!

24:18.160 --> 24:19.120
My brother is talking nonsense.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.370
G- Gui Xiao.

24:20.580 --> 24:22.060
You are Chen look good together.

24:22.100 --> 24:22.760
It wasn't easy for you two.

24:23.110 --> 24:23.800
Y- You look good together.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.580
Hasn't everyone had a crush?

24:26.400 --> 24:27.720
If Lu Chen hadn’t come back,

24:28.410 --> 24:29.640
you might have stood a chance.

24:30.220 --> 24:30.820
Brother, you...

24:30.850 --> 24:31.310
Alright.

24:31.340 --> 24:32.110
Let's stop talking.

24:35.820 --> 24:37.540
Why did you drink so much?

24:37.560 --> 24:37.850
Mom.

24:38.180 --> 24:39.390
Let me introduce them to you, Gui Xiao.

24:39.780 --> 24:40.620
This is my sister.

24:42.570 --> 24:43.240
This is my mom.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.620
We'll go in first.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.060
-Okay. -Go back.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.940
♫Easy come, easy go♫

24:50.220 --> 24:50.560
Alright.

24:52.420 --> 24:52.990
Where is the photo?

24:53.760 --> 24:54.340
Let me see.

24:55.370 --> 24:55.980
Chen.

24:56.210 --> 24:57.410
My brother is drunk.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.140
He was talking nonsense.

24:58.170 --> 24:59.010
I put it away a long time ago.

25:04.190 --> 25:05.100
I'll get it now.

25:05.130 --> 25:05.860
I'll get it for you now.

25:05.880 --> 25:06.680
W- Wait for me.

25:06.810 --> 25:07.340
There's no need!

25:36.960 --> 25:37.440
It's quite pretty.

25:42.050 --> 25:43.530
I don't even have this photo.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.720
Thank you for safekeeping it for me.

25:45.510 --> 25:46.030
You're welcome.

25:47.450 --> 25:48.570
We'll leave now.

25:49.140 --> 25:49.660
Go back in.

26:11.150 --> 26:12.250
I was so young back then.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.160
How did he get your photo?

26:19.660 --> 26:20.370
I don't know.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.220
I remember the teacher

26:22.220 --> 26:23.180
taking this photo.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.080
Maybe he asked the teacher for it.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.050
He's quite thoughtful.

27:31.130 --> 27:32.140
If you hadn't come to Qining,

27:33.830 --> 27:34.910
I wouldn't have come back.

27:37.610 --> 27:38.720
The last time I went to Qining,

27:40.580 --> 27:41.740
even if I hadn't lost my car,

27:42.710 --> 27:43.800
I would have gone to find you.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.110
I asked Huang Ting for your phone number

27:50.140 --> 27:51.040
two years ago.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.140
I can even recite it backwards.

27:59.950 --> 28:00.750
Recite it for me.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.060
I've forgotten now.

28:07.620 --> 28:08.460
You forgot it once you saw me?

28:22.790 --> 28:23.650
Call me before going to bed.

28:31.140 --> 28:31.540
Bye.

29:16.260 --> 29:17.890
I was worried that you'll sleep at the garage.

29:17.930 --> 29:18.800
There are too many prying eyes there.

29:20.180 --> 29:21.000
Come to think of it,

29:21.100 --> 29:22.140
Lu Chen is quite sensible.

29:22.630 --> 29:23.640
He really sent you here.

29:32.750 --> 29:34.180
It's no different from when you dated

29:34.180 --> 29:35.100
when you were young.

29:35.930 --> 29:37.140
You still can't bear to part with him.

29:37.620 --> 29:38.450
It's like you earn money

29:38.480 --> 29:39.650
by taking one more look at him.

29:41.810 --> 29:43.000
My parents are not home today.

29:43.100 --> 29:43.710
It's just the two of us.

29:57.310 --> 29:58.620
I saw his mother today.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.800
She doesn’t look like Lu Chen at all.

30:03.040 --> 30:03.880
I didn’t recognize her.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.490
His parents are hard to get along with.

30:07.810 --> 30:08.690
I can't be bothered to deal with them

30:08.710 --> 30:09.610
even though I'm so sociable.

30:10.130 --> 30:10.730
You

30:11.250 --> 30:12.390
better not see them often.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.070
Did you talk to him

30:17.120 --> 30:17.760
after sending Hai Dong back?

30:19.820 --> 30:20.270
No.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.370
You've cleared all the obstacles.

30:23.390 --> 30:25.050
Hurry up if you want to do something about it.

30:29.710 --> 30:30.670
I'll take my time.

Hello.

31:45.550 --> 31:46.300
I regret it.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.080
I should have stayed with you a little longer.

31:50.770 --> 31:53.110
♫Hey, what day is it today?♫

31:52.180 --> 31:53.070

What's wrong? Did you fall?

33:21.030 --> 33:21.570
Someone is coming.

33:22.050 --> 33:22.550
I'm leaving.

33:36.170 --> 33:36.710
Sleep early.

34:18.840 --> 34:19.800
Uncle Lu.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.630
I thought you weren't coming back

34:21.650 --> 34:22.889
to sleep tonight.

34:23.659 --> 34:24.449
Where else could  go?

34:27.139 --> 34:27.960
Have you gotten used to it here?

34:33.699 --> 34:34.380
Do you miss home?

34:36.960 --> 34:38.880
I've been here for so long.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.260
Why did you only ask me tonight?

34:51.060 --> 34:51.770
Aunt Gui Xiao...

34:54.699 --> 34:55.219
Uncle.

34:55.670 --> 34:56.380
What do you want to ask?

34:57.650 --> 34:58.100
Go to sleep.

35:07.290 --> 35:07.820
What has Aunt Gui Xiao

35:07.820 --> 35:08.570
been doing recently?

35:12.260 --> 35:12.970
I didn't have time to ask.

35:13.700 --> 35:14.760
Do you know about her job?

35:19.900 --> 35:22.900
Is there anything wrong with her work?

35:23.700 --> 35:26.150
Is it against the rules?

35:26.180 --> 35:26.750
No.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.860
I just want to know.

35:31.870 --> 35:33.350
Just ask Aunt Gui Xiao.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.030
It's 2 a.m.

35:39.270 --> 35:39.790
How do I ask?

35:42.030 --> 35:43.600
Ask her tomorrow.

35:49.220 --> 35:50.200
I'm not sure.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.730
I think she's an investor.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.960
She has money and looks for projects everywhere.

36:00.780 --> 36:05.180
She told her colleagues she was investing in...

36:05.730 --> 36:07.600
in educational...

36:08.980 --> 36:10.290
educational...

36:11.970 --> 36:12.890
new energy?

36:14.180 --> 36:15.180
I think so.

36:15.630 --> 36:15.980
Go to sleep.

36:18.770 --> 36:19.170
Your hand.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.400
Get up.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.390
You're going to be late.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.480
Stop it.

36:38.580 --> 36:39.420
I’m sleepy.

36:42.820 --> 36:44.020
Lu Chen is here

36:44.020 --> 36:45.270
to pick you up to go to school.

36:52.400 --> 36:52.950
I want...

36:53.490 --> 36:55.500
My flight is at twelve.

36:55.610 --> 36:56.980
Let me sleep until eight.

36:58.180 --> 36:59.220
Why would I lie to you?

36:59.220 --> 37:00.710
Lu Chen brought breakfast.

37:26.760 --> 37:27.020
Morning.

37:29.640 --> 37:30.190
I bought it for you.

37:37.780 --> 37:38.580
The auntie outside the school gate

37:38.620 --> 37:39.580
opened her own store.

37:40.260 --> 37:40.750
It tastes the same.

37:46.410 --> 37:47.470
It's still hot.

37:49.540 --> 37:50.260
Have you eaten?

37:51.180 --> 37:52.350
I ate at the garage.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.680
I didn't have time to eat on the way.

38:00.270 --> 38:01.260
I'm going back to work soon.

38:02.020 --> 38:02.590
There's a secret mission.

38:03.390 --> 38:05.190
I won't be able to use my phone for a while.

38:10.590 --> 38:12.110
The nature of my work is a bit different.

38:12.520 --> 38:13.530
I become uncontactable at times

38:14.840 --> 38:15.820
and cannot explain anything.

38:16.510 --> 38:17.600
I'm telling you in advance

38:17.990 --> 38:18.820
so you don't overthink this.

38:27.400 --> 38:27.730
Well...

38:28.680 --> 38:29.280
I'll be off now.

38:38.110 --> 38:38.620
You're still here?

38:42.530 --> 38:43.380
It was so busy

38:43.910 --> 38:44.680
this time.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.320
Let's talk properly

38:47.580 --> 38:48.260
when you come back from your business trip.

38:49.780 --> 38:50.270
About what?

38:54.750 --> 38:55.450
Your job.

38:55.980 --> 38:56.660
My job.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.480
My family background.

38:59.220 --> 38:59.830
The situation

38:59.860 --> 39:00.620
after my transfer back.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.180
My salary

39:02.850 --> 39:03.900
and my personal assets.

39:05.420 --> 39:06.410
When we were in school,

39:06.630 --> 39:07.810
I didn't tell you much about these.

39:08.410 --> 39:10.470
I want to make them clear this time.

39:15.330 --> 39:16.200
You're thoughtful.

39:16.540 --> 39:17.290
You should make them clear.

39:22.220 --> 39:22.830
Of course,

39:22.850 --> 39:23.620
if you

39:23.650 --> 39:24.650
just want to date,

39:24.680 --> 39:25.290
then it's not necessary.

39:25.320 --> 39:25.850
There's no need to say.

39:26.440 --> 39:27.550
It's good to retain

39:27.580 --> 39:28.480
a bit of the mystery.

39:28.690 --> 39:29.530
Go to work.

39:29.740 --> 39:30.640
I'm going too after I eat.

39:31.990 --> 39:32.290
Okay.

39:33.410 --> 39:34.060
We'll talk about it later.

39:38.980 --> 39:39.580
I’m leaving.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.130
Does your dad know Lu Chen is back?

39:57.260 --> 39:57.970
I don’t want to tell him.

40:06.150 --> 40:10.420
[Hongrun Chenghua]

40:12.370 --> 40:12.750
I thought

40:12.780 --> 40:14.090
you would wait for me at the airport.

40:14.820 --> 40:16.070
I saw that I still had some time,

40:16.420 --> 40:17.700
so I came back to attend the weekly meeting.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.750
You two. Tell me

40:22.780 --> 40:23.860
about your recent projects.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.330
Pass me the agenda.

40:34.130 --> 40:34.660
You go first.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.920
I'll tell you one by one.

40:35.990 --> 40:36.310
Okay.

40:36.710 --> 40:38.190
They insist that the shareholders

40:38.220 --> 40:39.540
should have veto rights.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.550
I told them

40:40.590 --> 40:41.590
I can't promise them something like that,

40:41.800 --> 40:42.840
and that the bosses on both sides

40:42.860 --> 40:43.510
need to discuss this directly.

40:44.210 --> 40:44.980
Make an appointment

40:44.980 --> 40:46.240
for a teleconference with Mr. Wu.

40:47.290 --> 40:48.210
After the secretary confirms it,

40:48.230 --> 40:49.250
email the other party

40:49.510 --> 40:50.590
and CC Mr. Wu and me.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.210
Also, they think

40:56.240 --> 40:57.920
the minimum of 13% of shares

40:57.940 --> 40:58.470
is too low.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.850
They're requesting a directly proportionate capital increase.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.330
We have been dealing with this

41:03.350 --> 41:05.020
for two weeks.

41:08.550 --> 41:09.110
How about this?

41:09.300 --> 41:10.270
Delete the clause on the contract

41:10.290 --> 41:11.390
that precludes capital increase

41:11.570 --> 41:12.600
and proceed with the negotiations.

41:12.940 --> 41:13.260
Okay.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.740
The bottom line I'm giving you

41:16.460 --> 41:17.660
is that we can add a clause for capital increase

41:17.680 --> 41:18.860
into the contract,

41:19.450 --> 41:20.930
but it cannot stipulate any specific requirements.

41:22.490 --> 41:23.880
For instance, terms like

41:24.300 --> 41:25.580
"directly proportionate"

41:25.600 --> 41:26.670
must not appear in the contract.

41:28.450 --> 41:28.940
Remember.

41:29.850 --> 41:30.330
We can only

41:30.360 --> 41:32.330
reveal our bottom line

41:32.490 --> 41:33.430
after at least three rounds of negotiation.

41:34.190 --> 41:34.500
Okay.

41:35.940 --> 41:36.670
Let me teach you.

41:37.610 --> 41:39.220
Every time the negotiations reach a stalemate,

41:39.580 --> 41:40.350
just say,

41:41.050 --> 41:42.310
"I can't make this decision.

41:42.740 --> 41:43.700
Let me ask my boss."

41:44.580 --> 41:46.910
Then, answer them the next day.

41:48.030 --> 41:50.180
If that doesn't work, tell them,

41:51.740 --> 41:53.620
"My boss is very unaccommodating.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.010
She's very difficult to talk to.

41:55.130 --> 41:56.970
I'll try to persuade her again."

41:57.750 --> 41:58.310
Yes.

41:58.330 --> 41:59.170
Blame it all on me.

41:59.710 --> 42:00.350
I am here

42:00.410 --> 42:01.540
to act as your shield.

42:02.690 --> 42:03.180
Don't worry.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.620
I won't take it to heart

42:04.690 --> 42:05.940
no matter how many bad things you say about me.

42:20.040 --> 42:20.440
Dad.

42:23.270 --> 42:23.960
I'm at the airport.

42:38.700 --> 42:39.570
My dad is here.

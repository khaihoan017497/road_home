21:18.860 --> 21:19.930
Why are you laughing?

21:22.740 --> 21:24.330
Why hasn't Haidong come recently?

21:27.130 --> 21:27.700
We broke up.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.660
It's fine that he kept

21:31.660 --> 21:32.500
fooling around with girls.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.260
He even flirted with

21:33.260 --> 21:34.530
that Zhao Minshan you know.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.010
That got me so angry.

21:36.270 --> 21:37.160
I scolded him

21:37.300 --> 21:37.850
and we broke up.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.630
Zhao Minshan?

21:51.980 --> 21:52.740
You are here too.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.060
Why aren't you going in?

21:58.460 --> 22:00.020
Can you listen to me?

22:00.680 --> 22:01.720
Give me a chance to explain.

22:01.750 --> 22:02.110
Okay?

22:02.130 --> 22:03.480
It's not what you think.

22:04.260 --> 22:05.410
Can you calm down? What are you doing?

22:05.860 --> 22:06.980
No, you...

22:08.010 --> 22:08.540
You know

22:08.560 --> 22:09.680
that woman.

22:10.390 --> 22:11.300
She likes to flirt,

22:11.300 --> 22:12.500
and also talk nonsense all day long.

22:12.620 --> 22:13.970
Last year,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.020
she even chased Lu Chen.

22:15.610 --> 22:16.480
What are you talking about?

22:18.300 --> 22:19.140
I swear.

22:19.140 --> 22:19.850
This is the last time.

22:20.220 --> 22:20.910
If I do this again,

22:20.940 --> 22:21.970
you can dump me immediately.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.120
You've been dumped.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.100
I refuse.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.190
The kids are watching.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.080
Why are you so curious?

23:19.170 --> 23:19.660
Hello?

23:20.700 --> 23:21.940
Hello? Xiao.

23:22.580 --> 23:23.180
What's wrong?

23:24.660 --> 23:25.540
My grandma has been

23:25.540 --> 23:26.940
getting a drip in the hospital these days.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.320
My brother and I are with her now.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.310
Do you want to come?

23:29.990 --> 23:30.920
He asked me to call you.

23:35.620 --> 23:36.460
To the hospital?

23:37.970 --> 23:38.560
Yes.

23:39.260 --> 23:41.020
I said you hate the hospital.

23:41.020 --> 23:41.700
You'd definitely not come.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.380
My brother said

23:43.620 --> 23:45.680
if he asked you to come,

23:45.700 --> 23:46.350
you will definitely come.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.300
Say something. Are you coming?

23:56.890 --> 23:57.540
Wait for me.

23:58.140 --> 23:58.860
I'm free anyway.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.440
Aunt, I'm leaving.

25:09.020 --> 25:09.700
Go back.

25:09.700 --> 25:10.660
I told you to go back.

I can't come back often

27:31.830 --> 27:32.930
I'll call you when I have time.

27:34.460 --> 27:35.450
I'll visit you during holidays.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.750
Zhao Lingling, let's go home.

27:58.620 --> 27:59.420
Do you hear me?

28:00.060 --> 28:00.900
Come back for dinner.

28:00.900 --> 28:01.820
Or the food will get cold.

28:07.970 --> 28:09.260
Let's make a deal first.

28:10.020 --> 28:10.460
Okay.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.350
Since we are together, we can't break up.

28:13.460 --> 28:14.620
Lu Chen, if you dare break up with me,

28:14.620 --> 28:15.530
I will cry to my death.

28:16.540 --> 28:17.250
Don't play around.

28:17.660 --> 28:18.950
Promise and swear.

28:19.700 --> 28:20.670
We can fight however we want,

28:20.700 --> 28:21.540
but we can't break up.

28:23.420 --> 28:24.550
Don't laugh.

28:24.860 --> 28:26.580
Behave yourself and answer seriously.

28:31.470 --> 28:32.430
You don't want to be serious?

28:37.300 --> 28:38.010
Never break up?

29:04.890 --> 29:05.660
Let me ask you.

29:07.970 --> 29:08.300
Go ahead.

29:10.430 --> 29:10.870
Why did you always

29:10.900 --> 29:12.460
throw chalk at me?

29:12.860 --> 29:13.980
Did you have a crush on me?

29:19.460 --> 29:20.660
You kept hanging around in front of me.

29:21.620 --> 29:22.910
Aren't you just trying to get my attention.

29:28.410 --> 29:29.780
You're just waiting for me to pull you back.

29:32.140 --> 29:33.140
You think too much.

29:52.270 --> 29:53.550
Why did you

29:54.020 --> 29:54.380
play billiards

29:54.380 --> 29:55.540
with me that day?

29:56.420 --> 29:57.850
Yes! Nice one.

29:57.880 --> 29:58.600
Good game.

29:58.730 --> 29:59.520
Let's go again.

30:00.170 --> 30:00.780
Who knows?

30:04.930 --> 30:05.660
Be honest,

30:06.300 --> 30:08.220
did you fall in love with me at first sight?

30:12.840 --> 30:13.480
How is that possible?

30:19.940 --> 30:21.220
You're not good at shooting.

30:21.700 --> 30:22.740
Fine. Listen to me.

30:22.940 --> 30:23.740
You even brought it here.

30:25.170 --> 30:25.820
Give it to me.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.480
Haidong, go!

30:28.580 --> 30:29.060
Haidong.

30:29.060 --> 30:29.740
Don't order me around.

30:29.740 --> 30:30.620
Nice!

30:30.620 --> 30:31.580
Follow my order.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.060
Come with me.

30:34.060 --> 30:34.680
Listen to me.

30:35.380 --> 30:36.140
The person I'm waiting for is here.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.020
Come here.

30:37.020 --> 30:37.660
Listen to me.

30:38.140 --> 30:38.780
This way.

30:39.140 --> 30:39.660
Follow me.

30:39.660 --> 30:40.460
- Slowly. - Be careful!

30:41.700 --> 30:42.340
Come on.

30:42.810 --> 30:43.340
Come on.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.060
One more round. Come on.

30:44.140 --> 30:44.620
This way.

30:45.890 --> 30:46.930
- Here, here! - Haidong.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.660
- What? - Help me find a restaurant

30:48.790 --> 30:49.350
and book a table.

30:50.580 --> 30:50.980
What for?

30:51.260 --> 30:52.420
I'm leaving for university soon.

30:53.030 --> 30:54.270
I want to buy everyone a farewell dinner.

31:06.270 --> 31:08.740
[Jingkai University of Finance and Economics]

31:06.270 --> 31:08.740
[2009 Admission Letter]

31:12.580 --> 31:13.420
If only you

31:13.440 --> 31:14.440
confessed to me earlier.

31:15.620 --> 31:16.300
At least

31:16.300 --> 31:17.540
we can live in the same city.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.460
I'll call you every day.

31:23.380 --> 31:23.970
It’s a deal.

31:33.420 --> 31:34.740
Where is Lu Chen? You broke up?

31:35.630 --> 31:37.180
He went into closed training.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.460
It's a long-distance relationship.

31:40.490 --> 31:41.620
And you can't even meet during the holidays.

31:42.140 --> 31:42.900
You guys are really

31:42.900 --> 31:44.280
dating with your imagination.

31:45.130 --> 31:45.760
It's true love.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.880
Go away. So annoying.

31:52.260 --> 31:53.500
I'm afraid that one day

31:53.500 --> 31:54.260
he'd tell me

31:54.860 --> 31:56.280
I don't feel anything anymore. Let's break up.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.500
No sense of security?

32:00.660 --> 32:01.990
It's Lu Chen...

32:02.550 --> 32:03.930
If it were me, I wouldn't feel secure either.

32:04.460 --> 32:05.460
He's so handsome.

32:06.220 --> 32:06.850
In our year,

32:06.850 --> 32:08.220
many girls liked him.

32:09.130 --> 32:10.230
As long as Lu Chen is willing,

32:10.380 --> 32:11.020
no one would

32:11.020 --> 32:12.510
reject him.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.580
Stop it.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.020
The more you say, the more confidence I lose.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.220
Has Haidong contacted you recently?

32:21.090 --> 32:22.150
We broke up a long time ago.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.290
Why would he contact me?

32:23.550 --> 32:24.940
If he looks for me again, he'd get beaten to death by my father.

32:28.590 --> 32:29.830
I didn't dare to ask

32:30.420 --> 32:32.290
Why did you break up?

32:34.500 --> 32:35.620
Zhao Minshan.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.220
It's still because of that famous

32:39.240 --> 32:41.240
campus beau in your year.

32:41.780 --> 32:42.770
It's her again?

32:46.260 --> 32:47.610
This is the drink your mom asked for.

32:47.610 --> 32:48.500
I brought it back.

32:51.660 --> 32:52.340
This is Qin Feng.

32:53.310 --> 32:53.840
Hello.

32:53.980 --> 32:54.500
Hello.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.740
Are you Gui Xiao?

32:57.590 --> 32:57.950
Yes.

32:59.580 --> 33:00.540
No introduction?

33:00.980 --> 33:01.980
Introduce what?

33:02.460 --> 33:03.310
Just call him brother-in-law.

33:08.380 --> 33:08.870
Alright.

33:08.900 --> 33:11.140
You two continue.

33:11.300 --> 33:11.870
I'm leaving.

33:13.050 --> 33:13.490
Bye-bye.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.500
He looks familiar.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.140
He's the boss of the venue I've

33:25.140 --> 33:26.540
once booked for my birthday party.

33:26.610 --> 33:27.250
Do you remember?

33:30.620 --> 33:31.460
When did you two...

33:33.350 --> 33:35.020
When I just broke up with Haidong,

33:35.150 --> 33:36.500
I couldn't recover over weeks.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.260
I stayed up all night

33:38.260 --> 33:39.190
playing games through the night at internet cafes.

33:39.740 --> 33:40.610
They're all places owned by him.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.030
One day,

33:43.180 --> 33:44.380
he came to me and told me

33:45.060 --> 33:46.220
that rascal

33:46.220 --> 33:46.790
is not worth it.

33:47.300 --> 33:47.940
Get together with me instead.

33:50.050 --> 33:51.780
I wanted to make Haidong angry.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.060
I agreed without thinking.

33:54.860 --> 33:55.900
Afterwards,

33:57.090 --> 33:58.330
I fell in love.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.060
Only you and Lu Chen are still going strong.

34:05.580 --> 34:06.870
I hope you can hang in there.

34:10.090 --> 34:10.770
I hope so.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.340
No winter vacation homework?

34:29.580 --> 34:31.139
No, it's not high school.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.190
Why don't you come out to watch some TV?

34:33.520 --> 34:34.440
Whose phone call are you waiting for?

34:35.540 --> 34:36.260
No.

34:38.260 --> 34:39.510
Your mom told me

34:39.739 --> 34:40.699
that you have a boyfriend.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.679
I need to answer the phone, Aunt.

34:46.820 --> 34:47.860
Please go out.

34:48.100 --> 34:48.820
Is there a secret?

34:48.820 --> 34:49.940
You don't want me to hear it?

34:57.100 --> 34:57.700
You're home?

34:58.740 --> 34:59.140
Just got home.

35:00.570 --> 35:01.010
Are you coming?

35:03.580 --> 35:04.420
My aunt

35:05.780 --> 35:07.100
won't let me go out today.

35:08.780 --> 35:09.410
Forget it then.

35:10.030 --> 35:10.720
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.860
Are you staying at home during winter break?

35:17.460 --> 35:19.210
No, I don't have a place at home.

35:19.850 --> 35:20.480
I'm staying in the garage.

35:34.380 --> 35:35.180
Who are you looking for?

35:35.670 --> 35:36.200
Lu Chen.

35:41.650 --> 35:42.800
Come in. I’ll get him for you.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.120
It's freezing.

36:29.900 --> 36:30.540
Come in if you're cold.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.240
I mean you're freezing.

36:33.700 --> 36:34.620
You wear so little.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.180
Are you surprised?

37:04.330 --> 37:05.040
Your girlfriend?

37:07.730 --> 37:09.970
I'm going to get married to the boss in the future.

37:11.660 --> 37:12.620
There's a car that's hard to repair.

37:13.090 --> 37:13.760
I'll finish it first.

37:14.260 --> 37:15.340
I'll stay with you then.

37:15.340 --> 37:16.700
I haven't seen you fix a car before.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.610
Luckily, you have a handsome face.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.570
No matter what you do, you still look good.

37:48.170 --> 37:48.790
Well,

37:48.820 --> 37:50.340
you have been going out every day.

37:50.340 --> 37:51.050
Where are you going?

37:51.500 --> 37:52.620
Nowhere in particular.

37:52.620 --> 37:53.560
Nowhere in particular?

37:53.740 --> 37:54.860
It's rare for you two

37:54.860 --> 37:56.460
long-distance lovers to meet, how can you go nowhere?

37:56.950 --> 37:58.780
It's too cold outside. I don't want to go out.

37:59.290 --> 38:01.090
It's quite fun to watch him repair cars in the garage.

38:01.470 --> 38:03.440
Young people are so easily satisfied.

38:04.100 --> 38:04.300
I'm not

38:04.300 --> 38:05.460
coming back for lunch today.

38:08.110 --> 38:09.710
Lu Chen is a good cook.

38:10.930 --> 38:12.340
How many times have you told me that?

38:38.080 --> 38:39.070
Go home and wash up.

38:39.420 --> 38:40.420
I was told that

38:40.420 --> 38:41.860
the water boiler here is solar-powered.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.810
The water temperature is not hot enough these days.

38:44.900 --> 38:45.830
It's too far to go and come back.

38:46.260 --> 38:47.340
I don't want to waste time on the way.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.080
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.360
I don't want you to wait.

39:20.980 --> 39:21.820
Come here.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.610
I've warmed up the bed.

39:27.020 --> 39:28.030
You won't be cold soon.

39:56.570 --> 39:57.100
Lu Chen.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.100
There's someone who's super annoying in school.

40:01.740 --> 40:02.830
They keep looking for me after school.

40:03.990 --> 40:05.010
I wish you were here.

40:06.740 --> 40:07.220
They're pursuing you?

40:28.300 --> 40:29.720
I don't want to watch it anymore.

40:40.590 --> 40:42.130
Why don't we switch a place?

40:42.570 --> 40:43.230
It's warm here.

40:43.660 --> 40:44.060
No need.

40:53.220 --> 40:58.400
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

40:55.540 --> 40:56.610
I’ll go get some water.

41:00.110 --> 41:04.860
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

41:06.830 --> 41:11.790
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

41:08.980 --> 41:09.540
Lu Chen.

41:12.860 --> 41:17.110
♫It becomes the truth of my empty dream♫

41:18.600 --> 41:19.620
If someone ever pursues you again,

41:20.250 --> 41:25.090
♫Love is the gentle looks of a youth♫

41:21.110 --> 41:22.020
say you have a boyfriend.

41:25.180 --> 41:25.780
I did.

41:27.110 --> 41:32.020
♫Be bolder, come closer♫

41:33.870 --> 41:38.920
♫You are the curtain call speech for my youth♫

41:39.840 --> 41:44.540
♫You are everything on my tiny planet♫

Lazybones.

01:46.850 --> 01:47.740
Get up. Hurry.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.920
I need to get some more sleep.

01:52.259 --> 01:53.500
Captain Lu's men are here.

02:01.090 --> 02:02.890
I haven't changed my clothes yet.

02:03.170 --> 02:04.130
Look how nervous you are.

02:04.130 --> 02:04.670
They're outside.

02:06.340 --> 02:07.550
Isn't the flight tomorrow?

02:07.870 --> 02:08.229
I just

02:08.259 --> 02:09.380
called him yesterday.

02:20.410 --> 02:21.370
Hello, Aunt Gui Xiao.

02:22.130 --> 02:22.890
Are you here alone?

02:24.250 --> 02:25.370
Uncle Lu is downstairs.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.680
Last night, Aunt Cai said

02:28.020 --> 02:28.950
she would take the train

02:28.970 --> 02:29.970
to go abroad for business today.

02:30.490 --> 02:31.970
My dad said he was off today.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.930
So he could send Aunt Cai off.

02:34.890 --> 02:36.410
Yes, I did mention it.

02:37.010 --> 02:37.770
Thank you so much.

02:38.460 --> 02:38.950
You're welcome.

02:48.079 --> 02:48.820
Good morning.

02:50.510 --> 02:51.010
Good morning.

02:51.240 --> 02:51.780
Morning, Captain Lu.

03:07.850 --> 03:08.650
Aunt Gui Xiao.

03:19.370 --> 03:19.710
Son.

03:29.079 --> 03:29.970
What time did you sleep last night?

03:32.210 --> 03:32.640
I didn't sleep.

03:33.570 --> 03:34.770
When we are on duty,

03:34.840 --> 03:36.570
it's normal not to sleep for a few days.

03:37.210 --> 03:37.800
I'm used to it already.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.090
It's not easy for the country to train you guys.

03:40.570 --> 03:41.450
You should take care of your health.

03:41.650 --> 03:42.940
So that you can work for a few more years.

04:00.320 --> 04:00.910
It's the border.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.780
Is the photo you sent to me

04:05.610 --> 04:06.230
taken here?

04:08.760 --> 04:09.180
No.

04:14.440 --> 04:14.960
Later on,

04:16.769 --> 04:17.920
if you come to Qining again,

04:19.050 --> 04:20.170
I'll ask them to take you

04:21.529 --> 04:22.430
to the place where the photo was taken.

04:26.100 --> 04:26.740
I don't know

04:26.800 --> 04:28.190
when will be the next time.

04:28.530 --> 04:29.530
The view here is nice.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.790
You should look more at

04:32.370 --> 04:33.090
the beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.090
You've lived here for more than ten years.

04:38.880 --> 04:39.470
I suppose

04:40.220 --> 04:41.970
it feels like looking at your hometown.

04:49.950 --> 04:57.680
[Qining Station]

05:07.890 --> 05:08.330
Captain Qin said

05:08.330 --> 05:09.690
he would help me watch over my car for a week

05:09.690 --> 05:10.350
until I returned.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.170
It's very nice of him.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.450
Captain Qin, thanks.

05:16.010 --> 05:16.930
Don't mention it. We're friends.

05:17.550 --> 05:17.990
Thank you.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.960
You may go through the customs and take the train from there.

05:24.610 --> 05:24.940
Captain Lu,

05:25.130 --> 05:26.050
once again, I would like to express

05:26.050 --> 05:26.890
my sincere gratitude to you.

05:27.570 --> 05:28.810
I'll treat you to a meal when I get back to Beijing.

05:29.970 --> 05:31.610
Captain Lu, see you again.

05:32.210 --> 05:32.530
Bye.

05:33.770 --> 05:34.900
Okay, you can go now.

05:35.010 --> 05:35.930
Take care.

05:36.490 --> 05:37.000
Have a safe trip.

05:37.250 --> 05:37.490
Okay.

05:37.520 --> 05:37.930
Bye.

05:44.350 --> 05:44.870
Aunt.

05:45.370 --> 05:46.159
Why don't you

05:46.159 --> 05:47.409
go abroad with them?

05:48.330 --> 05:49.490
I have work to do in Beijing.

05:49.510 --> 05:50.230
I need to go back to Beijing.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.560
The three of them came to Qining

05:53.830 --> 05:55.090
for foreign trade.

05:55.890 --> 05:57.409
Aunt, why are you here?

06:00.370 --> 06:02.450
Are you coming specially for Uncle Lu?

06:04.130 --> 06:04.820
No.

06:05.210 --> 06:05.770
How could it be?

06:08.850 --> 06:10.610
Xiaonan, if you keep talking nonsense,

06:10.610 --> 06:11.610
Aunt won't take you with her anymore.

06:18.550 --> 06:18.900
Lu.

06:19.810 --> 06:20.370
I've got an emergency mission.

06:21.410 --> 06:22.140
I'll leave them to you.

06:22.590 --> 06:22.950
Go ahead.

06:24.530 --> 06:26.050
Xiaonan, be obedient to Aunt.

06:29.530 --> 06:29.930
Thank you.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.570
Aunt, are you free after this?

06:37.000 --> 06:37.490
Yes, I am.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.210
Can you help me pack up my luggage?

06:41.810 --> 06:43.010
Why can't you do it yourself?

06:45.330 --> 06:45.970
What do you

06:45.970 --> 06:47.090
need help with from others?

06:48.080 --> 06:49.280
None of us can.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.010
Men are not careful enough.

06:51.610 --> 06:52.760
We'll leave something out.

06:56.690 --> 06:57.070
Okay.

06:57.930 --> 06:58.280
Thank you.

07:14.970 --> 07:16.920
Does he live alone?

07:19.810 --> 07:20.650
When his dad comes,

07:21.250 --> 07:22.410
he makes the bed up there

07:22.970 --> 07:23.530
and sleeps on the upper bunk.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.810
Why doesn't he apply for a dorm,

07:25.810 --> 07:26.650
taking his son together?

07:29.460 --> 07:30.420
In our profession,

07:31.530 --> 07:32.530
once there is a mission,

07:33.170 --> 07:34.050
our working hours will be uncertain.

07:35.530 --> 07:36.770
If the kid stays in the dorm,

07:37.510 --> 07:38.480
first, his resting will be disturbed.

07:39.270 --> 07:40.590
Second, seeing his dad often goes out,

07:41.080 --> 07:41.770
he'll be worried.

07:44.780 --> 07:46.090
Kids nowadays are smart.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.450
He knows his dad's profession.

07:48.850 --> 07:49.850
He'll be worried anyway.

07:51.180 --> 07:51.770
Besides,

07:51.770 --> 07:53.480
there're numerous movies about explosive ordnance disposal nowadays.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.090
Doesn't he

07:54.090 --> 07:55.450
ask you guys after watching them?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.409
Usually, we would say that

07:58.000 --> 07:59.070
the movie scenes are all made-up.

07:59.850 --> 08:00.570
It's not that dangerous.

08:03.460 --> 08:04.500
So it's all true.

08:06.410 --> 08:07.450
It's dangerous, isn't it?

08:13.340 --> 08:14.420
Can't you even tell your friends?

08:17.850 --> 08:19.050
Every profession has difficulty.

08:19.890 --> 08:20.650
There's nothing to say.

08:34.010 --> 08:34.650
Is this all?

08:39.130 --> 08:39.470
Doesn't his father

08:39.510 --> 08:41.059
buy him clothes?

08:42.210 --> 08:43.289
Also, why doesn't

08:43.289 --> 08:43.929
he rent

08:43.929 --> 08:44.890
a more spacious house?

08:46.370 --> 08:47.370
Isn't it too small

08:47.370 --> 08:48.730
for them to live here?

09:02.370 --> 09:03.060
Are they your parents?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.030
It's Uncle Lu and...

09:07.810 --> 09:10.910
Maybe

09:11.270 --> 09:12.330
his alumnus.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.970
Why can't I understand

09:15.170 --> 09:16.450
what you said?

09:19.530 --> 09:20.080
Captain Lu is here.

09:20.280 --> 09:20.950
I have to say hello to him.

09:22.410 --> 09:23.930
They're developing feelings for each other.

09:28.530 --> 09:29.750
Are they helping you pack

09:30.080 --> 09:30.740
and move?

09:32.660 --> 09:33.450
Thank you

09:34.190 --> 09:35.370
for taking care of me all this time.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.150
Why did you close the door?

09:38.520 --> 09:40.330
The kid outside will get it wrong.

09:42.090 --> 09:42.930
We can talk conveniently if the door is closed.

09:48.290 --> 09:49.050
His parents are divorced.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.490
Qin Mingyu got his son.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.720
But deep down,

09:54.470 --> 09:55.490
he felt that he had dragged on Xiaonan's mother,

09:56.250 --> 09:57.350
so he paid her a lot of money.

10:00.690 --> 10:01.170
I see.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.270
Now he has to take care of his parents

10:06.640 --> 10:07.400
and raise his son.

10:08.450 --> 10:09.210
So he doesn't dare to spend money freely.

10:15.330 --> 10:16.490
I've done packing the clothes.

10:17.290 --> 10:19.150
I'll leave the books for you to pack since you're more familiar with them.

10:19.530 --> 10:20.330
I'll go out first.

10:23.030 --> 10:25.940
♫We said it would last forever♫

10:25.970 --> 10:27.580
♫But we were separated in the end♫

10:27.880 --> 10:30.090
♫I wait until I give up all resistance♫

10:30.110 --> 10:31.840

10:31.920 --> 10:33.300
♫Never thought that love♫

10:33.320 --> 10:35.920
♫Is not about the trials and tribulations♫

10:36.210 --> 10:36.770
My dad said...

10:40.050 --> 10:42.170
My dad said that

10:42.550 --> 10:43.560
he was not coming back for dinner tonight.

10:43.890 --> 10:44.310
I got it.

10:47.410 --> 10:47.960
Let me see.

10:48.370 --> 10:49.110
It's okay.

10:49.370 --> 10:50.210
I'll go out first.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.250
Otherwise, the kid will misunderstand.

10:52.410 --> 10:52.850
Get out.

10:59.090 --> 11:00.450
This is even more misunderstanding.

11:13.810 --> 11:14.320
Remember to take

11:14.320 --> 11:15.330
Qin Xiaonan's household registration permit

11:15.400 --> 11:15.950
for boarding purposes.

11:20.570 --> 11:21.290
Stay in the car.

11:21.870 --> 11:22.780
I need to talk to your aunt.

11:41.060 --> 11:41.900
He doesn't have a household registration permit.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.250
He doesn't?

11:45.290 --> 11:45.840
His household registration permit

11:45.840 --> 11:46.730
has been with his mother.

11:47.470 --> 11:48.290
After the divorce,

11:48.330 --> 11:49.120
his mother always hopes

11:49.150 --> 11:50.090
Xiaonan can live with her.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.040
Although the court has made a judgment,

11:52.810 --> 11:53.580
these two

11:53.910 --> 11:55.270
have been dilly-dallying regarding household registration.

11:56.130 --> 11:56.950
Qin Mingyu is also busy

11:57.450 --> 11:58.440
that he has no time to do it.

11:59.450 --> 12:00.330
Then, what should we do?

12:04.770 --> 12:05.520
Does he have a passport?

12:06.000 --> 12:06.470
Yes.

12:07.900 --> 12:08.910
Give me his passport first.

12:09.370 --> 12:10.350
We'll discuss it after flying to Beijing.

12:11.050 --> 12:11.850
But we need

12:11.850 --> 12:12.850
both the original and photocopy

12:12.850 --> 12:13.540
of his household registration permit.

12:13.930 --> 12:14.730
The school will need to verify them.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.130
We'll figure this out this month.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.290
Poor kid.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.570
[No self-heating food in hand-carry or check-in luggage is allowed]

12:45.010 --> 12:45.450
Passport.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.540
I'll go back to Beijing after the Chinese New Year.

13:16.930 --> 13:17.610
It's almost time.

13:18.450 --> 13:18.900
You may go in.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.010
Goodbye, Uncle Lu.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.420
Alright.

13:26.170 --> 13:26.880
It's not like we'll never see each other again.

13:29.010 --> 13:29.770
We'll get going then.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.710
Why didn't your dad come to see you off?

14:30.490 --> 14:32.810
He hasn't been home for two days.

14:35.730 --> 14:36.930
He only called once.

14:39.850 --> 14:40.410
It's okay.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.450
You can visit him during the summer break.

14:43.310 --> 14:44.110
I may not able to see him

14:45.800 --> 14:47.120
even if I go back.

14:49.590 --> 14:51.630
Last year when I just arrived at Qining,

14:52.840 --> 14:54.360
my dad was on a mission,

14:55.690 --> 14:56.170
a confidential one.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.330
I couldn't see him for days.

15:02.480 --> 15:02.970
Then,

15:04.090 --> 15:04.900
what about you?

15:05.130 --> 15:05.970
Was there no one who took care of you?

15:06.890 --> 15:07.450
Yes.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.700
The family of other team members took turns taking care of me.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.670
But I cried every night.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.360
I thought my dad had abandoned me.

15:22.050 --> 15:22.810
Let me tell you.

15:23.730 --> 15:26.850
I even cried

15:26.850 --> 15:27.770
when I was in high school.

15:28.410 --> 15:29.730
My parents were divorcing at that time.

15:30.410 --> 15:31.090
So I cried a lot.

15:31.770 --> 15:32.770
You are so melodramatic.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.650
What's wrong with you?

15:37.650 --> 15:39.170
I was trying to comfort you.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.140
My dad said that I couldn't lie,

15:43.770 --> 15:44.680
especially to you.

15:46.870 --> 15:48.240
So I was being honest with you.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.410
I won't argue with you.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.300
I'll take you hanging out tomorrow.

15:56.870 --> 15:57.470
Where do you want to go?

15:58.030 --> 15:59.680
The Palace Museum, the Temple of Heaven

16:00.170 --> 16:01.210
or the Great Wall?

16:02.490 --> 16:03.010
How about this?

16:03.450 --> 16:03.930
I'll take you

16:03.960 --> 16:05.130
to visit

16:05.130 --> 16:05.890
all the famous tourist spots

16:06.560 --> 16:08.170
before we go to the local spots.

28:50.130 --> 28:51.810
Once, they went on a mission

28:53.250 --> 28:54.890
at a forbidden zone of life

28:54.910 --> 28:55.750
with an elevation of about 5,000 metres.

28:56.420 --> 28:57.890
They'd walked a dozen kilometres

28:58.840 --> 29:02.080
and carried out the villagers who passed out with oxygen deficiency.

29:03.150 --> 29:04.390
The villagers recovered after being carried out,

29:05.390 --> 29:06.730
but some team members had altitude sickness

29:07.160 --> 29:08.200
and almost died.

29:49.130 --> 29:49.930
How did you

29:50.890 --> 29:51.730
know each other?

29:54.600 --> 29:55.090
We're alumni.

29:55.630 --> 29:56.670
You're indeed alumni?

29:58.530 --> 30:00.360
I thought it was an excuse.

30:01.340 --> 30:02.820
His name was Lu Chen at first.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.160
Later, he changed his name by adding Yan in the middle.

30:05.930 --> 30:06.370
Do you know that?

30:08.890 --> 30:09.810
No wonder.

30:10.850 --> 30:11.610
No wonder what?

30:12.170 --> 30:14.250
That day in the parking lot,

30:15.090 --> 30:16.290
you called him Lu Chen.

30:17.490 --> 30:18.720
I felt weird at that time.

30:22.970 --> 30:24.080
Although we went to the same school,

30:25.200 --> 30:25.890
I hadn't met him

30:25.890 --> 30:26.850
at first,

30:27.400 --> 30:28.230
but always heard about

30:28.650 --> 30:30.320
Lu Chen in the 12th grade

30:30.760 --> 30:31.660
having a good look.

30:34.490 --> 30:35.280
And then?

30:38.030 --> 30:39.660
That's our business. Kids can't inquire about it.

This is my cousin, Lu Chen.

31:20.850 --> 31:21.500
Lu Yanchen.

31:22.530 --> 31:24.320
Yes, when he was in school,

31:24.340 --> 31:25.460
he changed his name because it duplicated with others.

31:25.930 --> 31:26.370
But we still

31:26.370 --> 31:27.360
call him Lu Chen.

31:36.420 --> 31:37.430
Boss, two more.

31:37.530 --> 31:38.130
Okay.

31:41.170 --> 31:42.370
Hi, Gui Xiao.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.170
Have you done your summer homework?

31:45.170 --> 31:46.080
Yet you're hanging out here.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.450
Aren't you the same?

31:47.810 --> 31:49.170
I'm going to celebrate Meng Xiaoshan and others' graduation.

31:49.250 --> 31:49.760
It's an exceptional case.

31:58.970 --> 32:00.130
Are you coming to celebrate Meng Xiaoshan's birthday,

32:00.130 --> 32:00.970
who has just graduated?

32:01.000 --> 32:01.450
Yes.

32:02.410 --> 32:04.060
Turn right. The innermost one.

32:04.230 --> 32:04.670
Thank you.

32:20.010 --> 32:20.630

32:20.930 --> 32:22.130
Believe it or not, I'll pocket all in the next round.

32:23.310 --> 32:24.030
I don't think so.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.520
We have made a bet.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.650
Whoever wins will buy the beverages.

32:38.770 --> 32:39.780
Won't he get a heat stroke

wearing so much?

32:43.170 --> 32:43.690

33:06.720 --> 33:08.480
You're even shorter than the cue stick.

33:09.300 --> 33:09.840
You'd better just watch them playing.

33:10.470 --> 33:11.470
Didn't you make a block booking?

33:11.500 --> 33:12.960
There are no outsiders here. I'm just playing for fun.

33:13.300 --> 33:13.890
Yes.

33:14.050 --> 33:15.210
You've booked for a whole afternoon anyway.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.400
I am no match for you.

33:50.690 --> 33:51.330
I'll use my left hand.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.950
The rule is who clears the table first, who wins.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.040

39:07.660 --> 39:09.630
So she remarried my uncle.

39:12.410 --> 39:13.610

39:17.890 --> 39:19.520
knew my cousin had applied for the police academy,

39:19.690 --> 39:20.800
he went crazy.

I want to eat pickled cabbage with vinegar sauce.

42:14.720 --> 42:15.190
One more.

42:42.170 --> 42:42.610
Coming.

42:44.760 --> 42:45.280
Good.

42:50.340 --> 42:50.780
Try it.

42:51.400 --> 42:51.840
Try it.

42:56.100 --> 42:56.610
Chen.

42:56.630 --> 42:57.970
Your cooking is so good.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.110
Of course.

43:00.750 --> 43:01.500
You don't have to rush back, right?

43:01.940 --> 43:02.700
It's my birthday today.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.870
We finally get together.

43:04.710 --> 43:05.110
Otherwise,

43:05.130 --> 43:06.280
I don't dare to waste your study time.

43:07.380 --> 43:07.990
No hurry.

43:08.060 --> 43:08.860
It's Friday.

43:10.210 --> 43:11.280
Okay, that's good.

43:11.940 --> 43:13.340
Try it. Lu Chen is good at cooking.

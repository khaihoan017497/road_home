01:35.380 --> 01:37.830
[Episode 8]

01:39.240 --> 01:40.259
One year before the Spring Festival,

01:41.680 --> 01:42.810
I participated in the bomb disposal,

01:44.460 --> 01:45.520
when my first love happened to be there.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.140
[2016]

01:51.259 --> 01:52.900
It's the New Year's Gala after the meeting.

01:53.340 --> 01:53.900
It looks like

01:53.900 --> 01:54.789
we're gonna celebrate the New Year together.

01:54.820 --> 01:55.300
Yeah.

02:14.610 --> 02:15.030
Captain Lu,

02:15.750 --> 02:16.940
we found something suspicious

02:17.020 --> 02:17.810
by the trash can in the backyard.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.460
We've checked it with a detector,

02:19.840 --> 02:20.360
and there's something wrong.

02:20.900 --> 02:21.660
Evacuate the crowd first.

02:21.920 --> 02:22.190
Yes, sir.

02:32.540 --> 02:33.640
What happened?

02:34.140 --> 02:35.110
They said nothing about it.

02:35.140 --> 02:36.020
Let's go out first.

02:36.620 --> 02:37.660
It might be a fire drill.

04:09.980 --> 04:10.880
A bomb that explodes as the pressure on it is gone.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.640
It has a simple structure.

04:13.730 --> 04:14.510
A large part

04:14.860 --> 04:15.610
inside the bomb

04:15.980 --> 04:17.290
may hold clues about the perpetrator.

04:18.610 --> 04:19.490
To protect these clues

04:19.820 --> 04:20.779
and trace the manufacturer,

04:21.500 --> 04:22.340
I suggest on-site demolition.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.180
The crowd has been evacuated.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.460
We agree on the on-site demolition.

05:09.910 --> 05:10.260
Sir,

05:10.280 --> 05:11.120
what's going on inside?

05:11.990 --> 05:12.510
Nothing.

05:12.750 --> 05:13.510
Just a routine check.

05:19.470 --> 05:20.680
We're just waiting here.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.390
Why don't we take a walk around?

05:24.940 --> 05:25.540
It seems that...

05:26.850 --> 05:27.740
According to my earlier search,

05:27.740 --> 05:28.740
there's a rice noodle restaurant nearby

05:28.740 --> 05:29.270
which is super famous.

05:31.000 --> 05:31.510
How about this?

05:32.180 --> 05:32.700
Luosifen.

05:36.340 --> 05:36.860
Not bad.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.250
Let's eat first.

05:38.700 --> 05:38.990
Let's go.

05:39.170 --> 05:39.420
Go.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.500
The detonator is successfully removed.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.490
Congratulations, guys.

06:10.510 --> 06:11.740
You can go back to celebrate the New Year.

06:13.390 --> 06:14.270
Did your first love know it?

06:18.550 --> 06:19.100
Nope.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.270
We had broken up at that time.

06:23.140 --> 06:23.560
Captain Lu,

06:23.940 --> 06:24.860
what does your first love look like?

06:30.430 --> 06:31.120
A couple of days ago,

06:31.410 --> 06:32.450
the test scores came out.

06:33.380 --> 06:34.180
Yours was not high.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.070
You shouldn't have asked about his first love.

07:03.550 --> 07:04.380
I've made an appointment

07:04.380 --> 07:05.430
with the class adviser.

07:05.940 --> 07:06.410
It's 3 p.m.

07:07.390 --> 07:08.270
on the 8th day of the first lunar month.

07:23.730 --> 07:25.100
You come to pick me up first that day.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.080
See you at 1 p.m.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.570
downstairs at my aunt's house.

07:48.650 --> 07:50.060
Are you in a relationship?

07:50.780 --> 07:52.790
You look distracted by your phone.

07:54.470 --> 07:55.450
Nah.

08:19.980 --> 08:21.260
You look just like a single man.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.100
Those in our team who have wives

08:23.100 --> 08:23.700
always report their safety

08:23.700 --> 08:25.020
to their wives by phone when they come back.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.810
Or the wives will surely be mad when they return home.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.810
[Lu Zheng Automobile Repair]

08:49.790 --> 08:50.740
Lu Chen,

08:51.060 --> 08:51.900
you are busier and busier

08:51.900 --> 08:52.960
with your work now.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.440
You still work your socks off during the Spring Festival.

08:55.820 --> 08:56.460
The Spring Festival is the busiest time.

08:58.150 --> 08:58.620
Go ahead.

09:26.170 --> 09:28.180
You've had enough fun outside.

09:28.210 --> 09:29.230
And you still know to come back, huh?

09:29.780 --> 09:31.630
Can I have a good talk

09:31.660 --> 09:32.870
with you today?

09:37.810 --> 09:39.360
I just want you to get married

09:39.860 --> 09:40.780
instead of doing

09:40.800 --> 09:42.110
anything evil.

09:42.180 --> 09:42.950
But do you have to

09:44.480 --> 09:45.280
treat me like this?

09:46.340 --> 09:47.650
You really embarrass me.

09:47.950 --> 09:48.800
How old are you?

09:49.330 --> 09:50.610
Are you gonna remain single forever?

09:51.180 --> 09:52.140
Hey, Lu.

09:52.730 --> 09:55.140
He has been on duty for days before returning home.

09:55.480 --> 09:56.580
He worked so hard.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.080
So did we!

09:59.720 --> 10:00.260
Did anyone

10:00.260 --> 10:01.320
ever take care of us in our childhood?

10:02.110 --> 10:03.260
I raised him with food,

10:03.260 --> 10:04.490
but he doesn't listen to me when he has grown up.

10:04.650 --> 10:05.550
Is that reasonable?

10:11.670 --> 10:13.700
You once served in the police force.

10:14.930 --> 10:16.680
Filial piety is paramount among all virtues,

10:16.990 --> 10:18.250
and filial piety is everything.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.830
Your father, who was a police officer,

10:20.860 --> 10:21.920
also taught you a lot, right?

10:22.490 --> 10:23.020
Why are you

10:23.020 --> 10:24.130
even more immature as you grow older?

10:28.080 --> 10:29.020
Think carefully.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.440
We still owe money to the Zhaos.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.010
I'll pay them back.

10:32.610 --> 10:33.570
You don't have to pay even a cent.

10:34.170 --> 10:34.970
D-Do you know

10:35.000 --> 10:35.900
how much money we owe them?

10:36.310 --> 10:36.710
I know.

10:37.740 --> 10:38.620
That's good.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.250
I can do nothing to help.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.690
You're pretty tough now.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.610
I knew it was worthwhile to bring my son up.

10:47.130 --> 10:47.860
Lu Chen,

10:48.700 --> 10:49.700
even if you

10:49.700 --> 10:50.860
hold a great grudge against me,

10:50.880 --> 10:52.280
you should come back for dinner once in a while.

10:52.310 --> 10:53.660
Your mom is still at home, anyway.

10:54.180 --> 10:55.020
Besides, I'm quite good

10:55.020 --> 10:56.080
at cooking.

10:57.010 --> 10:58.580
Tell me what you wanna eat

10:58.600 --> 10:59.600
before you come back

11:00.050 --> 11:01.330
so that I can prepare in advance.

11:21.920 --> 11:22.720
Would you like something to eat?

11:23.700 --> 11:24.070
No.

11:26.450 --> 11:27.660
Let me sleep for three hours first.

11:28.160 --> 11:28.910
I have something else to do in the afternoon.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.230
Okay.

11:36.020 --> 11:36.860
Get me

11:36.860 --> 11:37.570
a formal suit

11:38.030 --> 11:38.540
I'll wear it then.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.250
You're going to see your future father-in-law.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.940
Alright... I'll stop here.

11:45.940 --> 11:46.680
Why are you so shy?

11:46.950 --> 11:47.520
Here, take it.

11:48.120 --> 11:48.960
Let me think.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.050
I'll get you the most expensive one

11:52.270 --> 11:52.860
and iron it for you.

11:53.370 --> 11:54.050
I don't need the most expensive one.

11:54.610 --> 11:55.340
Just gimme a medium-priced suit.

11:56.130 --> 11:57.010
It's not your clothes.

11:57.030 --> 11:57.820
So it's up to me.

12:19.540 --> 12:21.000
Why did you come in a suit?

12:22.380 --> 12:23.110
I'll meet Gui Xiao later.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.270
No wonder.

12:25.980 --> 12:27.340
She came

12:27.370 --> 12:27.830
with the loan contract.

12:28.090 --> 12:29.140
Go inside and sign it.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.030
And then leave the rest to me.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.190
Lu Chen.

12:42.690 --> 12:44.060
Can I

12:44.080 --> 12:45.080
talk to him alone?

12:58.380 --> 12:58.960
This time,

13:00.230 --> 13:01.720
I did something wrong.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.190
But I want to marry you

13:04.220 --> 13:05.260
sincerely.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.100
I've never ever

13:26.420 --> 13:27.620
had any feelings for you.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.110
This is the first time

13:45.490 --> 13:46.370
we've met alone

13:46.390 --> 13:46.940
since our graduation.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.080
Xiaoshan,

13:50.440 --> 13:51.480
Hai Dong and I...

13:51.950 --> 13:52.820
That was just a childhood thing.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.220
It's meaningless to talk about it again.

13:55.740 --> 13:56.660
No matter what feelings

13:56.660 --> 13:57.490
you have for Lu Chen,

13:57.620 --> 13:58.610
it's time to end them today.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.100
Everyone knows what kind of person

14:00.100 --> 14:00.850
his father is.

14:01.530 --> 14:02.860
But Lu Chen grew up

14:02.860 --> 14:03.740
without wronging anyone,

14:03.770 --> 14:05.170
and neither did he ever

14:05.190 --> 14:06.630
fail you, Zhao Minshan.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.140
From beginning to end,

14:08.140 --> 14:09.100
you've been up to something.

14:13.150 --> 14:14.430
That's the end of this affair.

14:14.810 --> 14:15.500
You two families

14:15.520 --> 14:17.210
are no more than the creditor and the debtor.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.140
If you still don't get it,

14:19.330 --> 14:20.900
I'll get even with you from that year.

15:33.100 --> 15:33.540
Get in.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.140
I don't have any formal clothes.

15:55.920 --> 15:56.520
So I'm wearing Hai Dong's suit.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.960
Is it okay for me to meet the class adviser like this?

16:01.040 --> 16:01.600
Sure.

16:03.410 --> 16:04.300
It's my first time

16:04.300 --> 16:05.370
seeing you in a suit.

16:06.380 --> 16:06.930
I feel kind of weird.

16:08.230 --> 16:09.270
I'm not used to it, too.

16:15.330 --> 16:16.530
This place is still the same as before,

16:17.620 --> 16:18.420
without any change,

16:24.100 --> 16:24.540
Nothing has changed.

16:41.920 --> 16:42.370
Captain Lu.

16:42.990 --> 16:44.010
Hello, I've heard a lot about you...

16:44.350 --> 16:44.750
Hello.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.910
To get to know you,

16:47.350 --> 16:48.680
I've searched all over the Internet for your interviews.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.320
What a pity that there's only one article.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.490
A great hero like you

16:52.750 --> 16:54.410
should be promoted more.

16:54.650 --> 16:55.250
Enough.

16:56.790 --> 16:57.740
Sorry, Captain Lu.

16:58.080 --> 16:58.850
My husband

16:58.890 --> 16:59.820
just pretends to be passionate.

16:59.940 --> 17:00.520
He's excited in front of others.

17:01.190 --> 17:02.520
How can you say I pretend to be passionate?

17:02.550 --> 17:04.050
This is my sister's first love.

17:04.619 --> 17:05.750
Let's get down to business first.

17:06.319 --> 17:06.660
Okay.

17:07.900 --> 17:08.859
This class adviser

17:08.859 --> 17:09.859
is an old teacher,

17:09.880 --> 17:10.740
who's very responsible.

17:11.050 --> 17:12.220
She specifically asked to meet

17:12.220 --> 17:12.970
the Xiaonan's parents first

17:12.970 --> 17:13.810
just to know the kid's

17:13.810 --> 17:14.900
study and life conditions

17:15.310 --> 17:16.500
and other things like personality.

17:17.089 --> 17:17.970
I already called her

17:18.000 --> 17:18.800
in advance,

17:18.990 --> 17:19.900
and told her the kid's parents

17:19.940 --> 17:21.020
were not in Beijing.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.280
Just go upstairs and feel free to talk to her.

17:22.710 --> 17:23.589
Anyway, it's all for Xiaonan

17:23.589 --> 17:24.300
to get used to the new school life

17:24.300 --> 17:25.339
as soon as possible.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.330
Okay, thank you.

17:30.790 --> 17:32.030
It's all my husband's fault.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.250
I forgot to introduce myself.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.280
My name is Xia Xia,

17:34.450 --> 17:35.630
and I'm Gui Xiao's sister-in-law.

17:35.630 --> 17:36.310
He is Wen Cheng,

17:36.310 --> 17:37.070
Gui Xiao's cousin.

17:39.350 --> 17:39.860
Let's go upstairs.

17:40.390 --> 17:40.790
Okay.

17:42.070 --> 17:42.870
Gui Xiao's first love

17:42.870 --> 17:44.390
is so handsome

17:44.390 --> 17:45.430
with a good figure.

17:46.220 --> 17:47.300
That's enough...

17:48.950 --> 17:50.190
Do you think they still have a chance?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.450
I think so.

18:00.660 --> 18:01.230
Coming.

18:02.430 --> 18:03.110
Hello.

18:10.870 --> 18:11.510
Mom!

18:11.750 --> 18:12.850
Mom, we have some guests.

18:13.060 --> 18:14.390
Sister. brother-in-law, come here.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.180
Come in, please. No need to change your shoes.

18:17.550 --> 18:18.070
Do you know her?

18:23.810 --> 18:24.360
Hello, Mrs. Sun.

18:25.260 --> 18:25.790
Hello.

18:25.790 --> 18:26.100
Hello.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.710
This is Qin Xiaonan's uncle,

18:28.770 --> 18:29.380
Lu Yanchen,

18:29.830 --> 18:30.590
the one I mentioned to you

18:30.590 --> 18:31.430
on the phone.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.660
He just came back from Qining.

18:35.550 --> 18:36.310
Come in, please.

18:36.340 --> 18:37.070
Feel free to take your seats.

18:46.920 --> 18:47.510
Sister,

18:47.810 --> 18:49.300
he was the SWAT officer I talked about back then.

18:52.100 --> 18:52.630
Excuse me.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.440
Were you a SWAT officer before?

18:56.330 --> 18:56.620
Yes.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.110
And so am I now.

18:59.270 --> 19:00.420
We thought you changed your job

19:00.450 --> 19:01.510
when we saw you in a suit.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.160
Do I look familiar to you?

19:08.420 --> 19:09.900
It's normal that he doesn't know you.

19:11.030 --> 19:11.910
Just a few years ago,

19:12.110 --> 19:13.200
my sister and her classmate

19:13.220 --> 19:14.260
went on a graduation trip

19:14.610 --> 19:15.730
and encountered bad weather,

19:16.230 --> 19:17.520
when we were trapped on the mountain, unable to get down.

19:17.830 --> 19:18.980
Quite a lot of SWAT officers went to help us

19:19.070 --> 19:20.080
go down the mountain.

19:38.430 --> 19:39.310
Do you remember that?

19:39.510 --> 19:40.720
My classmate had straight hair,

19:40.850 --> 19:41.350
which was so long

19:41.620 --> 19:42.400
to the waist.

19:42.850 --> 19:43.780
I had curly hair,

19:43.920 --> 19:44.960
long brown and curly hair.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.450
I don't remember.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.950
He carries out tasks every day.

19:49.190 --> 19:50.230
Who knows how many people

19:50.230 --> 19:51.090
he has helped and saved?

19:51.280 --> 19:52.960
You are just one of them.

19:53.630 --> 19:55.530
I just feel it's so rare.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.390
Thank you.

19:56.550 --> 19:56.900
Seriously.

19:57.170 --> 19:57.590
Thank you so much.

19:58.370 --> 19:59.160
This is my duty,

19:59.820 --> 20:00.310
so don't mention it.

20:11.070 --> 20:11.470
Mom, here you are

20:12.990 --> 20:13.270
Here.

20:14.050 --> 20:15.320
This is the winter vacation homework.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.150
Bring it back.

20:16.820 --> 20:18.230
Xiaonan doesn't have to finish it all.

20:18.870 --> 20:19.670
I just want him to get used to

20:19.670 --> 20:20.230
the mode

20:20.230 --> 20:21.380
of our winter vacation homework.

20:21.490 --> 20:22.180
Just help him assimilate first.

20:23.580 --> 20:24.780
We'll leave Xiaonan to you

20:25.170 --> 20:25.810
from now on.

20:26.430 --> 20:27.830
To quote your lines,

20:27.830 --> 20:29.110
this is my duty,

20:29.130 --> 20:29.790
so don't mention it.

20:31.430 --> 20:31.990
Thank you.

20:42.110 --> 20:42.900
Do you really have no memory of it?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.340
I remember the mission and the time,

20:48.030 --> 20:48.600
but not the people.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.010
That mission came all of a sudden,

20:51.670 --> 20:52.950
and our entire team went there.

20:53.960 --> 20:54.770
The squadron of police dogs

20:55.060 --> 20:56.300
was also searching for people everywhere on the mountain.

20:57.510 --> 20:58.600
There were hundreds of tourists

20:58.750 --> 20:59.590
in the scenic back then,

21:00.340 --> 21:01.430
some of whom went really deep.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.330
After several hours of search and rescue,

21:03.690 --> 21:04.620
we searched all over the mountain.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.200
So I couldn't remember those faces at all.

21:09.580 --> 21:11.590
High winds, hypothermia, the narrow mountain roads,

21:11.830 --> 21:12.470
and a large number of tourists.

21:13.140 --> 21:14.020
In this case,

21:14.380 --> 21:15.660
we had no time

21:16.520 --> 21:17.360
to care about

21:17.400 --> 21:18.310
different people's faces,

21:18.570 --> 21:19.930
or whether it was the long hair or the curly hair.

21:20.510 --> 21:21.040
You're right.

21:32.380 --> 21:33.060
When I was in high school,

21:33.090 --> 21:34.200
I often went shopping here.

21:35.110 --> 21:35.820
In addition to this place,

21:35.850 --> 21:37.050
I also went to the clothing wholesale market

21:37.070 --> 21:38.040
next to the zoo.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.510
One of my cousins was really good at bargaining.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.880
Every time when I brought her out,

21:41.990 --> 21:42.910
I could save a lot of money.

21:43.580 --> 21:44.950
The cousin you met today

21:45.220 --> 21:46.820
was a follower when he was little.

21:47.150 --> 21:48.360
We didn't want to play with him.

21:48.980 --> 21:50.620
So he just cried and complained to others.

22:00.130 --> 22:00.840
Are these things

22:02.490 --> 22:04.170
unfamiliar to you

22:04.990 --> 22:05.870
now?

22:07.050 --> 22:08.080
I haven't come back

22:08.740 --> 22:09.670
since high school.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.270
During the years in Qining,

22:13.250 --> 22:14.150
I've been back

22:14.700 --> 22:15.590
less than five times.

22:17.270 --> 22:18.660
Actually, I don't know much

22:19.910 --> 22:21.150
about today's Beijing

22:21.680 --> 22:22.410
just like Qin Xiaonan.

22:28.040 --> 22:28.770
Welcome home.

22:43.990 --> 22:45.580
My brother's car is missing.

22:48.920 --> 22:49.440
The traffic is too congested.

22:50.220 --> 22:51.220
We can't find them now.

22:52.090 --> 22:53.220
Let's contact them when we get there.

23:03.190 --> 23:04.460
Actually, out of the only five times,

23:06.310 --> 23:07.420
I did it twice to see you.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.870
Why was it only once in my memory?

23:14.710 --> 23:16.170
You came back

23:16.430 --> 23:17.160
when I just went to college.

23:18.470 --> 23:19.580
And when you asked to break up with me.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.480
Did you come back at that time?

23:57.550 --> 23:58.700
I'm calling my brother

23:58.920 --> 23:59.760
to see if they've arrived.

24:15.140 --> 24:16.340
Call them in five minutes.

24:19.900 --> 24:20.300
OK.

24:24.470 --> 24:25.350
The thing concerning Zhao Minshan

24:26.870 --> 24:27.350
is over.

24:52.660 --> 24:53.260
You look so happy.

24:55.210 --> 24:56.140
Of course.

24:59.150 --> 25:00.590
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

25:01.820 --> 25:03.050
I had something serious to do with you this afternoon.

25:03.550 --> 25:03.990
So it was improper to talk about it.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.110
This is also a serious matter.

25:18.900 --> 25:19.350
Gui Xiao.

25:38.110 --> 25:38.810
They've arrived.

25:39.090 --> 25:39.780
Let's get off.

25:53.190 --> 25:54.270
Are you out of your mind again?

25:55.420 --> 25:56.590
I just subconsciously...

26:00.620 --> 26:01.740
My sinful hand...

26:10.630 --> 26:12.150
Sister, I didn't recognize

26:12.150 --> 26:12.950
Chen's car just now.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.370
That's why I honked.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.180
Never mind, but why are you so nervous?

26:25.090 --> 26:26.310
Let's go up from here.

26:51.830 --> 26:52.300
Sister,

26:52.940 --> 26:53.780
are you going to

26:53.780 --> 26:54.660
spend a lot of money today、

26:55.920 --> 26:56.780
Order whatever you want today.

26:57.070 --> 26:57.750
It's on me.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.010
Is there a budget limit?

27:01.470 --> 27:02.660
A month's salary.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.190
Is it enough?

27:03.940 --> 27:05.490
I'll take a good look then.

27:09.040 --> 27:09.440
Hello.

27:12.230 --> 27:12.720
Hello.

27:12.750 --> 27:13.790
We'd like to order this.

27:14.110 --> 27:14.480
OK.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.390
How much of this

27:16.410 --> 27:17.160
do you have today?

27:17.570 --> 27:18.920
There's only one kilogram left.

27:19.670 --> 27:20.860
That should be enough for four people.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.400
I'll go check it with you later.

27:22.780 --> 27:23.080
Okay.

27:23.240 --> 27:23.950
And this one, too.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.020
Okay.

27:25.870 --> 27:26.780
The dishes here

27:26.780 --> 27:27.510
are all offered

27:27.510 --> 27:28.290
at the day's supply price,

27:28.480 --> 27:29.270
just to keep them fresh.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.130
Table 13.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.070
Check, please.

27:38.940 --> 27:39.720
Just a minute, sir.

27:45.290 --> 27:46.040
Waiter, may I have the bill, please?

27:47.300 --> 27:48.390
The gentleman who just left

27:48.420 --> 27:49.580
has paid the bill.

27:53.860 --> 27:54.820
Could you please show me the bill?

27:55.570 --> 27:56.410
Okay, please hold on a moment.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.030
Hello, madam.

28:09.290 --> 28:10.850
Captain Lu is quite generous!

28:12.040 --> 28:12.320
Sister,

28:12.950 --> 28:14.080
your first love

28:14.160 --> 28:15.440
is from a rich family, right?

28:17.270 --> 28:17.690
Waiter,

28:18.090 --> 28:19.390
please pack

28:19.390 --> 28:20.550
the rest of the food for me.

28:21.020 --> 28:21.370
Okay.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.280
Thank you.

29:13.790 --> 29:14.300
Get down to work.

29:41.810 --> 29:42.610
This is the winter vacation homework

29:42.640 --> 29:43.560
assigned by your new school.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.720
Although the teacher didn't ask you

29:45.750 --> 29:46.300
to finish it all,

29:47.150 --> 29:48.120
you still should do it all

29:48.760 --> 29:49.310
since you're free recently.

29:50.130 --> 29:50.690
Don't slack off.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.030
I'm going to dismantle some cars.

30:12.570 --> 30:13.480
Go to bed if you're sleepy.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.370
I'll sleep next door.

30:17.590 --> 30:18.430
Some cars?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.290
I can only see him tomorrow morning indeed.

30:36.350 --> 30:37.110
Luckily, your family

30:37.110 --> 30:38.130
run a garage.

30:39.560 --> 30:40.110
There you are.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.920
The barbecue I ate was quite good.

30:43.180 --> 30:44.020
So I've packed some for the kid.

30:47.350 --> 30:49.190
You don't look like you're in trouble.

30:49.190 --> 30:50.400
You look good!

30:50.530 --> 30:51.530
Why are you dismantling the cars?

30:54.950 --> 30:55.720
I see.

30:56.340 --> 30:57.890
You disassemble cars whether you're happy

30:57.910 --> 30:59.120
or sad, right?

31:01.310 --> 31:01.800
Chen.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.670
I just came back from a business trip,

31:08.710 --> 31:10.430
and my brother told me you were transferred to Beijing.

31:10.450 --> 31:11.620
So I followed him to see you right away.

31:12.590 --> 31:13.230
Good.

31:13.260 --> 31:14.460
You haven't changed a bit over the years.

31:15.130 --> 31:15.820
You haven't changed either.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.680
I just finished my homework.

31:25.030 --> 31:25.910
I'm going to bed.

31:26.520 --> 31:26.880
Go ahead.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.180
Is he your kid, Chen?

31:33.450 --> 31:33.820
No.

31:34.190 --> 31:34.630
It's my friend's.

31:35.910 --> 31:36.750
I thought you got married

31:36.750 --> 31:37.630
in Qining.

31:37.790 --> 31:38.550
Nah.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.150
He's waiting for Gui Xiao.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.440
Stop talking nonsense.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.110
Other people may have no idea about it,

31:43.110 --> 31:43.870
but I know.

31:45.910 --> 31:46.970
Gui Xiao in our class?

31:47.230 --> 31:48.350
Of course. Who else can it be?

31:50.660 --> 31:52.300
Chen and Gui Xiao were once in a relationship?

31:53.530 --> 31:54.210
They

31:54.350 --> 31:55.330
fell in love after graduation.

31:55.370 --> 31:56.160
Many people don't know that.

31:57.620 --> 31:58.900
Why didn't you tell me?

31:59.110 --> 32:00.200
Why should I tell you?

32:02.350 --> 32:02.800
What are you looking at?

32:02.830 --> 32:03.710
Pour Chen a drink.

32:04.200 --> 32:04.760
No.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.260
It's my shift tomorrow afternoon, so I can't drink.

32:12.210 --> 32:13.650
Don't drink directly with the bottle.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.670
How can I drink it in this case?

32:14.700 --> 32:15.290
Pour it into the glass.

32:18.170 --> 32:18.810
Help yourself.

32:19.130 --> 32:20.850
I'm so happy to see Chen.

32:21.270 --> 32:21.910
Here you are, Chen.

32:28.030 --> 32:28.470
I won't drink.

32:29.170 --> 32:30.260
He already said that.

32:40.290 --> 32:40.940
Thank you.

32:53.620 --> 32:54.500
I'm fine.

32:54.990 --> 32:55.590
I'm fine.

32:55.610 --> 32:56.110
Thank you.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.200
Go continue to talk to my brother.

32:58.230 --> 32:58.830
I'm fine.

32:58.910 --> 32:59.470
Thank you, Chen.

32:59.470 --> 33:00.190
Leave him alone.

33:00.190 --> 33:01.150
Just let him throw up.

33:01.150 --> 33:02.200
He'll be fine after that.

33:02.430 --> 33:03.100
Come back and sit.

33:03.210 --> 33:03.500
Sit.

33:07.310 --> 33:08.560
His condition

33:09.550 --> 33:10.840
reminds me of my past.

33:12.570 --> 33:13.810
When Meng Xiaoshan got married,

33:15.090 --> 33:15.760
I almost

33:15.790 --> 33:17.000
drank to death in front of their house.

33:18.910 --> 33:20.050
And in the next half a year,

33:20.900 --> 33:22.330
I shed all my tears

33:22.360 --> 33:23.120
of half my life.

33:25.350 --> 33:26.100
Have you ever cried

33:27.270 --> 33:27.940
for Gui Xiao?

33:31.330 --> 33:32.500
It also counts if you cried secretly.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.560
Have you cried for her?

33:40.820 --> 33:41.350
What are you doing?

33:41.990 --> 33:43.070
Since you already said it,

33:43.090 --> 33:44.370
just finish the story.

33:49.070 --> 33:49.830
She wanted to break up with me.

33:51.450 --> 33:52.640
I called her over and over again.

33:53.770 --> 33:54.850
She hung up every time.

33:56.830 --> 33:57.970
She didn't even let me

33:58.020 --> 33:58.800
say anything.

34:00.190 --> 34:01.240
Then I didn't dare to call her.

34:02.110 --> 34:03.760
I was afraid she would be scolded by her family if I called too many times.

34:09.489 --> 34:10.440
Half a year after our breakup,

34:09.900 --> 34:13.150
[2012]

34:11.199 --> 34:12.480
I finally had a chance to return to Beijing.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.110
And I had to leave the next day.

34:16.590 --> 34:17.150
That night,

34:18.940 --> 34:20.000
she still refused to meet me.

34:22.159 --> 34:22.880
I didn't go home.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.120
I stayed at the train station until dawn,

34:26.219 --> 34:26.870
and then left directly.

34:56.810 --> 34:57.530
I'm in Beijing.

34:59.920 --> 35:00.780
Let's go out to meet.

35:22.180 --> 35:26.220
♫You gradually feel nothing about my sharing♫

35:28.830 --> 35:32.310
♫Hang on to coldness♫

35:33.640 --> 35:34.160
Forget about it.

35:33.830 --> 35:36.640
♫I can't say good night♫

35:39.640 --> 35:44.450
♫I once believed hard work would leave no regrets♫

35:46.740 --> 35:49.910
♫But the ending is too bad♫

35:50.980 --> 35:57.820
♫Who will shoulder it for me?♫

35:59.380 --> 36:02.310
♫We said it would last forever♫

36:02.310 --> 36:03.910
♫But we were separated in the end♫

36:04.260 --> 36:06.550
♫I wait until I give up all resistance♫

36:06.550 --> 36:08.110
♫Let time pass by♫

36:08.320 --> 36:10.170
♫Never thought that love♫

36:10.170 --> 36:12.100
♫Is not about the trials and tribulations♫

36:12.420 --> 36:15.480
♫Not that easy♫

36:16.730 --> 36:19.720
♫Let's wait until the turn♫

36:19.720 --> 36:21.420
♫Still have expectations♫

36:21.660 --> 36:23.320
♫In the night without you♫

36:23.320 --> 36:25.590
♫I can't shed a tear♫

36:25.770 --> 36:29.380
♫Street lights on the corner and the darkness I passed by♫

36:29.610 --> 36:31.120
You came back after you broke up, huh?

36:29.770 --> 36:33.020
♫Everything's too late♫

36:35.230 --> 36:36.600
I know you're single-minded.

36:37.060 --> 36:37.870
But I didn't expect

36:37.870 --> 36:39.190
you to have such deep feelings for Gui Xiao.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.270
I should go back.

36:52.410 --> 36:52.850
Wake up.

36:54.110 --> 36:54.510
Let's go.

36:56.290 --> 36:56.600
Let's go.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.460
I'll pick up Qin Xiaonan tomorrow.

37:03.770 --> 37:05.160
I have to send Hai Jianfeng back first.

37:06.060 --> 37:07.110
His mom really loves him.

37:08.150 --> 37:09.370
If he doesn't return in the middle of the night,

37:09.860 --> 37:11.720
she'll scold either him or me.

37:11.830 --> 37:12.230
See you.

37:12.780 --> 37:13.130
Go ahead.

37:13.350 --> 37:13.900
Chen,

37:14.590 --> 37:15.940
wish you two all the best.

37:28.010 --> 37:28.680
Did you buy it?

37:30.810 --> 37:31.650
Who else could it be other than me?

37:33.520 --> 37:34.670
Aunt Gui Xiao, of course!

37:36.280 --> 37:37.700
You're not related to her.

37:37.970 --> 37:38.880
Dare you take it at will?

37:39.220 --> 37:40.060
No.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.360
So,

37:41.550 --> 37:42.230
I'm writing it down.

37:43.170 --> 37:45.200
When I make money,

37:45.890 --> 37:47.630
I'll take inflation into account

37:48.000 --> 37:48.680
and pay her back together.

37:49.230 --> 37:50.110
Good.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.330
But remember,

37:52.990 --> 37:54.000
you need skills to pay her back.

37:54.790 --> 37:55.960
Don't break her heart.

37:57.290 --> 37:57.770
Of course.

37:59.350 --> 37:59.810
Let me see.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.570
You're about to be as handsome as me.

38:03.460 --> 38:04.150
What a narcissist.

38:08.880 --> 38:09.720
I can't buy you clothes of really good brands

38:10.790 --> 38:12.030
since I've been saving money these years.

38:13.530 --> 38:14.150
But,

38:15.020 --> 38:16.020
new clothes for Chinese New Year.

38:16.580 --> 38:17.180
This is the custom.

38:18.040 --> 38:18.480
I know.

38:18.990 --> 38:20.190
Let's go and eat.

38:23.700 --> 38:28.840
[Xie's Special Beef Noodles]

38:38.490 --> 38:39.420
This is your Aunt Gui Xiao's

38:39.420 --> 38:40.160
favorite restaurant

38:40.460 --> 38:41.430
when she was a student.

38:42.910 --> 38:44.120
I want to eat what she likes.

38:46.580 --> 38:47.780
Is this your son?

38:49.810 --> 38:50.240
No.

38:50.340 --> 38:50.830
My nephew.

38:53.170 --> 38:54.120
I thought you got married

38:54.160 --> 38:55.280
with that girl and had this kid.

38:57.380 --> 38:58.330
Which girl?

38:58.980 --> 38:59.870
You know what?

39:00.550 --> 39:01.260
Your uncle

39:01.560 --> 39:03.040
always brought that girl

39:03.060 --> 39:03.750
to eat noodles here before.

39:04.110 --> 39:05.220
She looked so pretty,

39:05.490 --> 39:06.560
and was really good at eating spicy food.

39:07.290 --> 39:08.270
She ate one bowl of noodles

39:08.420 --> 39:09.750
with half a bottle of spicy sauce.

39:10.470 --> 39:11.180
It was summer,

39:11.350 --> 39:12.780
and even I was sweating when I saw her eating.

39:14.410 --> 39:14.850
Same as usual.

39:15.510 --> 39:15.870
Two bowls.

39:16.620 --> 39:16.980
Okay.

39:17.000 --> 39:17.530
Just a moment.

39:48.390 --> 39:48.750
What?

39:50.370 --> 39:51.240
Don't you want to take the chance

39:51.500 --> 39:52.030
of the Spring Festival

39:52.030 --> 39:53.820
to invite Aunt Gui Xiao to hang out?

39:54.830 --> 39:55.540
Mind your own business

39:55.840 --> 39:56.800
instead of ours.

39:58.010 --> 39:58.700
Were it not for

39:58.720 --> 39:59.910
Aunt Gui Xiao,

40:00.390 --> 40:01.260
I wouldn't care about you.

40:06.800 --> 40:07.560
Here are your noodles.

40:10.370 --> 40:10.830
Enjoy your meal.

40:10.950 --> 40:11.340
Thank you.

40:45.230 --> 40:45.790
Are you busy?

40:59.170 --> 40:59.930
I'm off today.

41:03.670 --> 41:04.390
Are you...

41:17.590 --> 41:19.160
How is Qin Xiaonan doing?

41:31.050 --> 41:31.730
He said

41:32.230 --> 41:32.910
he missed you.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.210
Me too.

41:57.750 --> 41:58.770
I'll take him to see you.

42:08.830 --> 42:09.240
Don't bother.

42:10.220 --> 42:11.090
I'll go to meet him,

42:12.020 --> 42:13.160
and visit Meng Xiaoshan by the way.

42:30.970 --> 42:31.600
Your reward.
